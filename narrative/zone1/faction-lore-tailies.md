## Origin Story

### The Boarding (Day Zero)

When the freeze came, Snowpiercer was Wilford's vision — a self-sustaining ark for those who could pay. The train had 1,034 cars, meticulously designed to sustain civilization in motion. First Class bought tickets years in advance. Second Class were professionals deemed essential. Third Class were workers recruited for their skills.

The Tail was never part of the plan.

On boarding day, as Snowpiercer prepared to depart, thousands of desperate people stormed the rear of the train. With the freeze already killing, Wilford faced a choice: spend precious departure time removing them, or close the doors and go. He chose to go.

The rearmost cars — originally empty cargo containers and equipment storage — became the Tail. No seats. No beds. No food. No plan for their survival. The Tailies boarded with nothing and were given nothing.

**The First Year:**
- No food system existed. Wilford sent nothing for three months.
- The Dark Time: when food ran out, some Tailies ate the dead. Then the living. This lasted approximately six weeks before the protein blocks arrived.
- Gilliam lost his arm during this period — self-amputation to feed others. At least, that's the story he tells.
- An estimated 120 people died in the first year from starvation, violence, exposure, and disease.

**Year 2-5: The Formation**
- The protein block system was established. Insect colonies were introduced to the Tail — the front's solution to feeding people they hadn't planned for.
- The Council formed organically. Gilliam, the oldest person who remembered civilization, became the natural leader.
- Social structures emerged: the Workshop, the Nursery, the Pit. The Tailies created a society from nothing.
- The first revolt (Year 3) was crushed at Car 14. 74 dead. This established the Martyr's Gate.

**Year 5-10: The Hardening**
- A second, smaller revolt attempted the undercarriage route. It failed. The Forgotten retreated into the Dark Car.
- The Kronole trade began. Chemical waste from the train's industrial systems was discovered to have narcotic properties. Someone in the forward sections began deliberately sending raw Kronole to the Tail.
- Children began disappearing. Taken forward for "apprenticeships." None returned.
- The Council formalized: five members, each responsible for an aspect of Tail society.

**Year 10-17: The Pressure Builds**
- Rations decreased. The Tail's population grew (births) while the food supply didn't.
- Disease became endemic. The Cough appeared around Year 12 and never left.
- The Listening Post was established. Yuri, blinded in the second revolt, began mapping the train by sound.
- The Workshop secretly produced weapons. Anvil began the armament that would enable the current revolt.
- Gilliam's source in the front began sending information. (Unknown to the Tail: this is part of Wilford's control mechanism, though Gilliam has turned this channel genuine.)

## Social Structure

### Leadership: The Council of Five

| Seat | Name | Role | Philosophy |
|------|------|------|------------|
| 1 (Head) | **Gilliam** | Overall leadership, external relations | Patient revolutionary. Believes timing is everything. |
| 2 | **Martha** | Logistics — food, water, space allocation | Pragmatic survivalist. Every resource counted twice. |
| 3 | **Samuel** | Security — defense, discipline, training | Militant. Wants to fight now. Chafes under Gilliam's patience. |
| 4 | **Asha** | Medical — health, sanitation, population | Compassionate realist. Knows the Tail is slowly dying. |
| 5 | **(Vacant)** | Community — education, morale, culture | Previously Reza. Taken forward six months ago. Presumed dead. |

**Decision Process:** Majority vote with Gilliam as tiebreaker. In practice, Gilliam's opinion carries outsize weight because he has information (from his source) that others don't. Samuel resents this imbalance.

### Social Classes Within the Tail

Even the bottom of the train has hierarchy:

**The Core** — Original boarders and their families. Highest social standing. They remember the old world and carry knowledge (literacy, technical skills, history) that the Tail-born don't have.

**The Tail-Born** — Born on the train. Never saw the sky. They know only the Tail and treat it as the world. Often more resilient than the Core but lack historical context. The player is Tail-born.

**The Fallen** — Former Third or Second Class residents who were punished by demotion to the Tail. Distrusted by other Tailies (they once had privilege), but they carry knowledge of the forward sections. Reza was one of these.

**The Forgotten** — Those who retreated into the Dark Car. Technically still Tailies, but they've severed all ties. Most Tailies pretend they don't exist.

### Labor Distribution

Everyone works. There is no leisure class in the Tail.

| Job | Workers | Prestige |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Protein Processing** | 8 + rotating | Low (disgusting work) but essential |
| **Weapon Smithing** | 6 | High (warriors of the revolution) |
| **Child Care** | 3 + parents | Medium (respected but seen as "soft" duty) |
| **Medical** | 3 | High (life-savers) |
| **Listening** | 4 | Medium-High (intelligence is valued) |
| **Fighting/Training** | 15-20 active | Highest (the tip of the spear) |
| **Scavenging** | Rotating | Low-Medium (dangerous crawlspace work) |
| **Kronole Processing** | 3 | Low (distrusted, but customers don't complain) |

## Culture and Beliefs

### The Three Faiths of the Tail

The Tail has no unified religion, but three belief systems compete:

**1. Engine Atheism (Majority)**
Most Tailies reject the forward sections' Engine worship. They view the Engine as a machine, Wilford as a man, and the class system as oppression — not divine order. Their faith is in each other and the revolution.

**2. Quiet Worship (Minority)**
Some Tailies, especially older ones, secretly believe in the Engine's divinity. They don't worship Wilford but believe the Engine itself is sacred — it keeps them alive, after all. They pray quietly and are mocked if discovered. This creates an interesting tension when the player reaches the Cathedral (Zone 6).

**3. The Thaw Believers (Small, Secret)**
A handful of Tailies believe the outside world is warming. They study every hull breach, every temperature fluctuation, every sound from outside for evidence. They don't want to reach the Engine — they want to open the doors. This faction becomes significant in the endgame.

### Oral Traditions

Without books (paper is fuel for the Nursery stove), the Tail preserves knowledge orally:

- **The Boarding Stories** — First-hand accounts of boarding day, passed from parents to children. Growing increasingly mythologized.
- **The Names of the Dead** — Recited at gatherings. Every Tailie who has died is remembered by name. The memorial wall in Car 1 is the physical record; the oral tradition is the living one.
- **Songs of the Outside** — Songs about rain, grass, sunlight, animals — things only the Core remember. The Tail-born sing them without understanding, like hymns in a dead language.
- **Curtis's Story** — The legend of the last major revolt leader. Depending on who tells it, he's a hero who almost made it or a monster who went too far. The truth is more complex, and it mirrors the player's own journey.

### Rituals

- **The Count** — Every morning, Jackboots count the Tail. Tailies have turned this humiliation into a solidarity ritual: they count back, louder, affirming their own existence.
- **The Share** — When someone has extra food (rare), they share it publicly. Not eating in front of the hungry is the closest thing to a moral law in the Tail.
- **The Wake** — When someone dies, the Tail gathers in Car 1. Names are scratched into the memorial wall. The body is stripped of useful materials (cloth, metal fittings) and placed in the undercarriage to be taken by the wind. Pragmatic and dignified.
- **The Pit Rites** — Fighting in the Pit follows unspoken rules: no killing (usually), no eye-gouging, stop when Grey calls it. These rules make the Pit a pressure valve rather than a slaughterhouse.

## Key Relationships

### With Other Factions

| Faction | Relationship | Detail |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Third Class Union** | Potential allies | Workers in Third Class are one bad day from becoming Tailies. Common cause exists. But Third Class fears the Tail's desperation — they don't want the revolution to drag them down too. |
| **The Jackboots** | Enemies | The physical enforcers of the Tail's imprisonment. Hatred runs deep. However, some Jackboots are former Third Class conscripts who didn't choose their role. |
| **The Bureaucracy** | Unknown | The Tail has almost no contact with Second Class governance. They're an abstraction — "the system" — not people. |
| **First Class Elite** | Mythic enemies | Most Tailies have never seen a First Class passenger. They're practically fictional — stories of sushi and saunas and hot water sound like fairy tales. |
| **The Order of the Engine** | Ideological enemies | The religious veneration of the Engine is an insult to Tailies who suffer under it. But some Quiet Worshippers feel conflicted. |
| **The Kronole Network** | Complicated | Kronole comes from outside the Tail. Someone supplies it. The Network spans all classes and operates in shadows. The Tail needs them but doesn't trust them. |
| **The Thaw** | Secret alignment | Thaw Believers in the Tail connect secretly with Thaw members in other zones. This is the most cross-class faction on the train. |

### Internal Tensions

- **Gilliam vs. Samuel:** Patience vs. action. Samuel has wanted to attack for years. Gilliam has held him back, citing timing. Now that the revolt is happening, Samuel fears Gilliam will find another reason to wait.
- **The Core vs. The Tail-Born:** Generational tension. The Core mourns the old world; the Tail-born can't mourn what they never had. The Core sees the revolt as restoration; the Tail-born see it as creation.
- **Fighters vs. Caregivers:** The Workshop and the Nursery compete for resources (scrap metal for weapons vs. maintenance for the stove). Neither is wrong.
- **Kronole Users vs. Everyone:** The Den is controversial. Some see it as a necessary escape valve; others see it as weakness that undermines the revolt.

## The Tailie Aesthetic

**Visual Language:**
- Colors: Blue-gray, rust-brown, soot-black. No bright colors. Clothing is patched, layered, functional.
- Materials: Scrap metal, wire, rubber, cloth. Everything is repurposed at least three times.
- Light: Fluorescent flicker, orange forge-glow, darkness. Never natural light.
- Posture: Hunched from low ceilings. Alert from constant threat. Exhausted from inadequate food.

**Audio Language:**
- Ambient: Train vibration (loudest in the Tail), dripping water, distant mechanical groaning.
- Social: Whispered conversations, children's muffled laughter, the rhythmic clang of the Workshop.
- Threat: Jackboot boots on metal, the morning count, radio static from Car 15.

**The Emotional Core:**
The Tail should feel like a place the player wants to fight for. Not because it's comfortable — because it's *theirs*. Every hand-painted star, every shared protein block, every name on the memorial wall is an act of defiance. The Tail says: we were given nothing, and we made a home. We were told we're worthless, and we proved otherwise. Now we're coming for the rest of the train.
