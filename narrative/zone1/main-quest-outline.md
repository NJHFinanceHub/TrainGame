## Pacing Notes

**Cars 1-3** should feel tutorial-paced: deliberate, guided, low pressure. The player is learning.

**Cars 4-5** increase the emotional and narrative stakes. Choices begin to matter. The revolution starts.

**Cars 6-8** are preparation. The player should feel like they're gearing up — visiting a shop before a dungeon. This is the last "safe" section.

**Car 9** is a hard escalation. The combat should feel dangerous after the relative safety of the Tail.

**Cars 10-11** shift genre: horror, then survival. The player is out of their comfort zone in every sense.

**Cars 12-13** provide a brief respite and moral complexity before the finale.

**Car 14** is the emotional climax — the revelation, if the player has the Numbers.

**Car 15** is the action climax — the boss fight, the door, the crossing.

**The zone should end with the player feeling:** accomplished, burdened by choices, curious about what lies ahead, and protective of the Tail they're leaving behind.
