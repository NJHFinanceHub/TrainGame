# Collectibles System

> *"Every scrap of paper, every scratched symbol, every whispered recording — they're not just relics. They're proof we were here."*

## Overview

Snowpiercer contains **247 collectibles** distributed across 7 zones and exterior areas. Collectibles serve as primary environmental storytelling devices, rewarding exploration with lore, gameplay benefits, and completion tracking. Every collectible is hand-placed with narrative intent — no random spawns.

## Collectible Types

### 1. Train Logs (48 total)

Official Wilford Industries documentation — maintenance reports, passenger manifests, engineering schematics, and administrative orders. These reveal the train's operational history and the bureaucratic machinery behind its class system.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 4 | Early boarding records, ration formulas, population counts |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 8 | Work shift logs, accident reports, quota enforcement |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 9 | Administrative memos, class mobility denials, resource audits |
| Zone 4: Working Spine | 10 | Engineering diagnostics, system failure logs, repair histories |
| Zone 5: First Class | 7 | Luxury requisitions, complaints filed, privilege schedules |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 5 | Inner circle correspondence, Wilford directives, loyalty tests |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 3 | Sacred engine specifications, the Original Design, final logs |
| Exterior/Secret | 2 | External sensor readings, pre-launch test data |

**Gameplay Reward:** Completing a zone's Train Logs unlocks a "Systems Access" bonus for that zone — highlighted interactable objects, bypass codes for select locked doors.

**Visual Design:** Weathered clipboards, laminated cards, and terminal printouts. Wilford Industries logo watermark. Zone-colored border trim (Tail = rust, Third = grey, etc.).

### 2. Audio Recordings (42 total)

Personal recordings made by train inhabitants on salvaged devices — confessions, letters home to nobody, arguments captured accidentally, and deathbed testimonies. The most emotionally resonant collectible type.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 5 | Boarding day memories, children's voices, revolt planning |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 7 | Worker grievances, love across class lines, union whispers |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 7 | Middle-class guilt, informant confessions, family fractures |
| Zone 4: Working Spine | 6 | Engineer journals, the sound of failing systems, night shift talks |
| Zone 5: First Class | 7 | Decadent parties, existential despair beneath luxury, secret doubts |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 5 | Wilford's private musings, loyalty oaths, dissent recordings |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 2 | The last engineer's testimony, engine-room ambiance log |
| Exterior/Secret | 3 | EVA team recordings, someone who went outside and came back |

**Gameplay Reward:** Each recording plays ambient VO during exploration (can be replayed from journal). Collecting 10+ unlocks "Keen Ear" passive — environmental sound cues become more distinct (subtle audio highlighting of hidden interactables).

**Visual Design:** Small cassette-like devices, wired earbuds, or terminal playback stations. Each has a hand-written label. Glow subtly when in proximity (within 3m) if player has PER 8+.

### 3. Artifacts (38 total)

Physical objects from the pre-Freeze world or significant train events — photographs, personal items, religious icons, tools, toys. Each has an inspect mode with 3D rotation and detailed flavor text.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 5 | Boarding tokens, personal effects confiscated at entry |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 6 | Work tools repurposed as weapons, union badges, family photos |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 7 | Pre-Freeze consumer goods, books, musical instruments |
| Zone 4: Working Spine | 5 | Prototype parts, old maintenance tools, engineer mementos |
| Zone 5: First Class | 6 | Luxury items (watches, jewelry, art), contraband from lower classes |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 4 | Wilford's personal collection, cult objects, surveillance devices |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 2 | Original engine key, Wilford's blueprint annotations |
| Exterior/Secret | 3 | Frozen objects from outside, pre-boarding equipment |

**Gameplay Reward:** Artifacts can be traded, gifted to companions (loyalty bonuses for matching interests), or displayed in player's claimed space (aesthetic). Collecting 20+ unlocks "Historian" reputation — NPCs with academic/curious traits offer additional dialogue options.

**Visual Design:** 3D inspectable objects. Each has wear, damage, and patina appropriate to its history. Interact prompt shows silhouette outline before pickup.

### 4. Blueprints (32 total)

Technical schematics for weapons, tools, modifications, and train systems. The primary crafting-progression collectible — finding blueprints unlocks new recipes at crafting stations.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 3 | Improvised weapons (Shiv variants, Pipe Mace, Scrap Shield) |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 5 | Worker tools (Bolt Cutter, Welding Torch), Tier 1 upgrades |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 5 | Precision tools, lockpicks, medical devices, Tier 2 weapons |

| Zone 5: First Class | 4 | Luxury weapons (fencing saber, gold-plated revolver), gadgets |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 4 | Wilford-tech (surveillance countermeasures, advanced medical) |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 2 | Engine-powered prototypes, the Ultima weapon schematic |
| Exterior/Secret | 2 | Cold-suit upgrades, exterior-only tools |

**Gameplay Reward:** Direct gameplay impact — each blueprint unlocks a craftable item or upgrade. Blueprints are the most mechanically significant collectible type. Finding all blueprints in a tier unlocks a "Mastery" bonus mod slot for items in that tier.

**Visual Design:** Translucent blue-white technical drawings on engineered paper. Fold-out format with annotation arrows. Some are torn (requiring multiple pieces found across cars to complete).

### 5. Faction Intel (52 total)

Intelligence gathered by or about the train's factions — Tailies, Jackboots, Wilford Loyalists, Third Class Union, The Breachmen (maintenance workers), First Class Council, and The Order of the Engine. Faction Intel directly affects the reputation and intel systems.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 6 | Tailie revolt histories, informant lists, Jackboot patrol schedules |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 9 | Union membership rolls, strike planning, Third Class resistance |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 8 | Bureaucratic faction maps, who reports to whom, blackmail dossiers |
| Zone 4: Working Spine | 8 | Breachmen codes, maintenance access maps, sabotage evidence |
| Zone 5: First Class | 8 | Council voting records, alliance charts, hidden agendas |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 7 | Order of the Engine doctrine, initiation records, loyalty rankings |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 3 | The truth about the Engine, Wilford's succession plans |
| Exterior/Secret | 3 | Inter-faction communication intercepts, spy networks |

**Gameplay Reward:** Each piece of Faction Intel fills in a "Web of Power" diagram in the journal, showing faction relationships, key players, and vulnerabilities. Collecting 5+ for a faction unlocks special dialogue options with that faction's members. Collecting all for a faction reveals their "Critical Weakness" — a narrative tool that opens unique quest solutions.

**Visual Design:** Coded messages, hand-drawn maps on cloth, carved bone markers, intercepted radio transcripts. Each faction has a distinct visual identity: Tailies use scratched metal, Jackboots use military forms, First Class uses embossed stationery, etc.

### 6. Manifest Pages (35 total)

Torn pages from Snowpiercer's original passenger manifest — the definitive record of who boarded, where they were assigned, and what happened to them. The manifest was deliberately destroyed early in the train's journey; recovering it is a meta-narrative thread.

| Zone | Count | Theme |
|------|-------|-------|
| Zone 1: The Tail | 4 | Tail passenger list (names the player recognizes), boarding conditions |
| Zone 2: Third Class | 6 | Worker assignments, skill inventories, family groupings |
| Zone 3: Second Class | 6 | Professional credentials, class assignment justifications |
| Zone 4: Working Spine | 5 | Engineer roster, maintenance team histories, accident victims |
| Zone 5: First Class | 5 | Ticket prices, privilege tiers, who bought their way on |
| Zone 6: The Sanctum | 4 | Inner circle selection criteria, loyalty scores, psychological profiles |
| Zone 7: The Engine | 2 | The final pages — who was meant to drive, and who actually does |
| Exterior/Secret | 3 | Pages blown outside during an early breach, preserved in ice |

**Gameplay Reward:** Manifest Pages reconstruct a searchable passenger database in the journal. Cross-referencing names with NPCs, graves, and lore entries reveals hidden connections — family members separated across classes, people listed as dead who are alive (or vice versa). Collecting 25+ pages unlocks the "Manifest Truth" quest — revealing why it was destroyed.

**Visual Design:** Yellowed, water-stained ledger paper with printed columns and handwritten entries. Some pages are partially burned, torn, or redacted with black ink. Completing adjacent pages in the manifest shows redacted entries becoming partially legible.

## Discovery Mechanics

### Proximity Detection

Collectibles use a tiered detection system based on player stats:

| PER Score | Detection Range | Indicator |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1-4 | 1.5m | None (must physically see it) |
| 5-7 | 3m | Subtle controller vibration / audio ping |
| 8-10 | 5m | Vibration + HUD compass pip |
| 11+ | 8m | Vibration + compass pip + faint glow outline |

**Blueprints** always show a faint glow regardless of PER (they're too important to miss entirely).

### Hidden Collectibles

Approximately 30% of collectibles (74 items) require environmental interaction to access:

- **Behind false walls** (STR 8+ to break, or find switch): 12 items
- **Inside locked containers** (CUN 6+ lockpick, or find key): 18 items
- **In vent systems** (accessible via vent crawl): 15 items
- **Requiring companion interaction** (specific companion comments trigger discovery): 8 items
- **Environmental puzzle** (pressure plates, sequence switches, timed): 11 items
- **Exterior only** (rooftop or under-car access required): 10 items

### Missable vs. Persistent

- **Persistent (85%):** Remain in the world permanently. Can be collected at any time via backtracking.
- **Timed (10%):** Available only during specific story events or windows. Clearly signaled by environmental cues (e.g., an NPC holding a document during a scene — interact before the scene ends).
- **Choice-Dependent (5%):** Only available on certain narrative paths. A single playthrough cannot collect all 247. Maximum per playthrough: ~235. This encourages replayability without punishing completionists excessively.

## Collectible Quality Tiers

Each collectible has an implicit rarity that affects its journal presentation:

| Tier | Count | Journal Border | Significance |
|------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Common | 120 | Bronze | Background lore, minor details |
| Uncommon | 72 | Silver | Important context, minor gameplay |
| Rare | 38 | Gold | Major revelations, significant gameplay |
| Legendary | 17 | Platinum + glow | Game-changing lore, unique items/abilities |

Legendary collectibles include items like:
- Gilliam's Confession (Audio Recording) — the full truth about his deal with Wilford
- The Original Manifest (Manifest Page) — the unredacted first page listing true boarding criteria
- Engine Heart Schematic (Blueprint) — unlocks the Ultima weapon modification
- Wilford's Kill List (Faction Intel) — names every person Wilford ordered eliminated
- The Outside Photograph (Artifact) — a photo showing plant growth, taken 6 months ago

---

## Companion Collectible Interactions

Each companion has **3-4 collectible "resonance" items** — specific collectibles that trigger unique dialogue, reveal backstory, or affect loyalty:

| Companion | Resonance Collectibles | Effect |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| Pike | Union badges, revolt records | +15 loyalty, reveals his role in the 3rd revolt |
| Josie | Children's artifacts, the List | +20 loyalty, deepens her rescue motivation |
| Brakeman | Jackboot patrol logs, duty rosters | +10 loyalty, reveals his conflicted loyalties |
| Frost | Engineering blueprints, system logs | +15 loyalty, unlocks unique crafting recipes |
| Grey | Sanctum intel, Order documents | +10 loyalty, reveals his true history |

When a resonance item is found with the matching companion present, they interrupt with a contextual reaction — picking up the item, examining it, sometimes refusing to let the player take it (creating a micro-choice).
