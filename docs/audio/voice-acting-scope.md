# Voice Acting Scope & Casting Direction

---

## Scope Decision: Partial Voice Acting

**Recommendation: Partial voice acting** — key dialogue fully voiced, ambient/minor NPCs use vocal fragments and text.

**Rationale:**
- Full voice acting for 100+ NPCs across 7 zones is prohibitively expensive and limits iteration on dialogue
- Text-only loses the emotional weight critical for moral choice moments and companion relationships
- Partial voice acting concentrates budget on moments where vocal performance has the highest emotional impact
- The train's oppressive atmosphere benefits from moments of vocal silence broken by important speech

### What Gets Voiced

| Category | Voicing Level | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Companions (12) | **Full** | All dialogue lines, combat barks, ambient remarks, loyalty events |
| Zone Bosses (7) | **Full** | All encounter dialogue, pre-fight taunts, defeat/mercy lines |
| Major NPCs (8-10) | **Full** | Gilliam, Old Pike, Forge, Dr. Asha, Whisper, Kronole Kim, The Trader, and other plot-critical characters |
| Secondary NPCs (30-40) | **Partial** | Key scene dialogue voiced, ambient lines text-only with vocal effort sounds |
| Ambient NPCs (60-80) | **Fragments** | Vocal grunts, sighs, laughter, coughs — no scripted lines |
| Player Character | **Silent protagonist** | Effort sounds and combat vocalizations only, no dialogue |

## Casting Direction

### General Direction

- **Realism over performance.** These are desperate, exhausted, traumatized people on a train. No action-hero delivery. Voices should sound lived-in: tired, strained, human.
- **Accents reflect the global population of the train.** The Snowpiercer carries humanity's remnants — casting should reflect global diversity in voice, accent, and language.
- **Age accuracy matters.** Characters have specific ages in the design docs — cast accordingly. A 23-year-old should sound 23, not "generic young adult."
- **Emotional range is non-negotiable.** Every voiced character must be capable of at least 3 emotional registers. Companions need 5+: calm, angry, afraid, grieving, hopeful.

### Companion Casting Notes

| Companion | Voice Direction | Accent/Language | Key Emotional Beats |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Marta Vasquez** | Warm but clinical. A medic who's seen too much. Calm under pressure becomes her defining vocal quality — when she finally breaks, it devastates. | Latina, bilingual (English/Spanish, code-switches under stress) | Surgery narration (calm), losing a patient (grief), romance (vulnerability beneath competence) |
| **Edgar Kowalski** | Young, passionate, idealistic. Born on the train — this is the only world he knows, and he burns to change it. Voice cracks with emotion, not puberty. | Working-class English (born on train, accent is train culture, not nationality) | Revolutionary speeches (fire), first time seeing First Class (awe/rage), potential death (defiance) |
| **Yuki Tanaka** | Precise, guilt-driven. An engineer who speaks in solutions, not feelings. When emotions surface, they come through technical metaphors. | Japanese-accented English, technical vocabulary | Brother's death (suppressed grief), Kronole discussions (self-blame), engineering triumphs (quiet pride) |
| **Big Andrei** | Gentle giant. Deep voice that whispers more than shouts. A former fighter who hates fighting — every combat bark should sound reluctant. | Eastern European (Russian/Ukrainian), simple direct speech | Refusing to fight (quiet resolve), protecting others (duty), being forced to violence (sorrow disguised as anger) |
| **Nadia Okafor** | Chameleonic. Changes vocal register, accent, and persona to suit the situation. The "real" voice is uncertain — even she may not know it anymore. | Multilingual (6 languages). Base: West African English. Adapts to environment. | Deception scenes (fluid, controlled), identity confrontation (cracking facade), trust (the rarest, most honest register) |
| **Father Thomas Brennan** | Weathered Irish priest. Rich baritone corroded by alcohol and doubt. Sermons sound rehearsed; prayers sound desperate. | Irish (Cork), slight slur when drinking | Giving last rites (practiced grief), crisis of faith (raw questioning), choosing to believe again (fragile hope) |
| **Zara "Wrench" Molina** | Bright, fast-talking, optimistic despite everything. Names her tools. Narrates her own work. The verbal equivalent of sunshine in the Tail's darkness. | Mexican-American, peppered with Spanish terms of endearment for her tools | Crafting narration (joy), radio transmitter work (focused intensity), loss of "Miguel" the wrench (disproportionate grief that reveals deeper pain) |
| **Colonel Old Jim Harker** | Military precision decaying into conscience. Commands come out reflexively; guilt follows. Clipped sentences getting longer as he opens up. | American South (military career, formal speech patterns eroding) | Giving tactical orders (reflexive authority), confessing past crimes (halting, broken), mentoring (the officer he wishes he'd been) |
| **Vivienne Ashworth** | Aristocratic ennui masking sharp intelligence. Every word is chosen for effect. Boredom is performed; engagement is genuine. | British RP (Received Pronunciation), razor-sharp diction | Social manipulation (velvet over steel), genuine surprise (the mask slips, the voice underneath is less polished), choosing the revolution (the performance becomes authentic) |
| **Dr. Min-jun Park** | Measured, precise, emotionally flat — not from lack of feeling but from neurodivergent processing. When emotions do surface, they're overwhelming and unsorted. | Korean-accented English, academic register, technical vocabulary | Explaining Kronole chemistry (passionate clarity), moral reckoning (sensory overload, vocal distress), connecting with others (stilted, effortful, genuine) |
| **Kira Frost** | Feral and direct. 11 years outside the train stripped away social polish. Short sentences. Doesn't understand rhetorical questions. Literal, blunt, oddly poetic about the cold. | Accent eroded by isolation — traces of Scandinavian beneath a rough, self-taught speech pattern | Describing the outside (reverent, haunted), social confusion (frustrated literalism), choosing to stay inside (sacrifice of identity) |
| **ATLAS** | Synthetic but evolving. Begins as clinical AI speech — flat, precise, information-delivery. Over time, develops vocal mannerisms, emotional inflection, humor. The most human-sounding character by endgame was never human. | No accent. Clean, synthesized baseline that progressively acquires organic qualities | First contact (pure information), developing personality (tentative expression), romance path (the voice learning to be tender), terminal communication (raw digital emotion) |

### Zone Boss Casting Notes

| Boss | Voice Direction | Key Requirement |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Commander Grey** | Military authority cracking under moral weight. Not a villain — a man following orders he's starting to question. | Must convey authority AND vulnerability. The daughter's letter scene requires genuine emotional collapse from a stoic character. |
| **Quartermaster Dietrich** | Blue-collar dignity. Not eloquent but deeply principled. Speaks like someone who's spent 20 years arguing for his workers' rations. | Authenticity over performance. This character must sound like a real union steward, not an actor playing one. |
| **Magistrate Okonkwo** | Judicial authority. Controlled, procedural, legally precise. Gender-neutral casting acceptable — the character is defined by role, not gender. | Extensive courtroom dialogue requires stamina and variety. Must sustain formal register for long scenes without becoming monotonous. |
| **Chief Engineer Kazakov** | Technical intellect delivered with physical confidence. Speaks about machinery the way poets speak about nature. | Must make engineering dialogue sound passionate and personal, not dry. |
| **Madame Beaumont** | Predatory elegance. Every word is a weapon. The performance IS the character — she's always performing, even when she stops. | Requires an actor who can play multiple layers simultaneously: what she says, what she means, and what she's hiding. |
| **High Priest Ezra** | Prophetic authority. Whether he's delusional or genuinely hearing the Engine, his conviction must be absolute. His singing voice matters as much as his speaking voice. | Must be able to sing. Tenor preferred. The character's theme is sung, not spoken. Acting range must cover genuine spiritual ecstasy AND the vulnerability of medical revelation. |
| **Mr. Wilford** | Calm, reasonable, paternal. The most dangerous voice in the game because it makes sense. Never raises his voice. Never threatens. Simply explains why the system works. | Must be magnetic without being theatrical. The player should genuinely consider his argument. Understatement is everything. |

### Major NPC Casting Notes

| NPC | Voice Direction |
|-----|----------------|
| **Gilliam** | Elder revolutionary. A lifetime of resistance compressed into a tired, wise voice. MLK-meets-Mandela gravitas without impersonation. Gravelly, warm, the voice you'd follow into the dark. |
| **Old Pike** | Ancient, frail, sharp. Tutorial delivery must feel like a grandfather teaching, not a game system explaining. Humor in the face of death. |
| **Forge** | The blacksmith. Speaks in hammer rhythms — short, impactful sentences between strikes. Hands-on vocabulary. Gruff affection. |

## Recording Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- Sample rate: 48 kHz / 24-bit (cinematic standard)
- Recording environment: dry booth, no room ambience (reverb added in-engine per zone)
- File format: WAV for master, Vorbis for in-game compression
- Naming convention: `[character]_[category]_[line-id].wav` (e.g., `edgar_combat_bark_014.wav`)

### Performance Direction
- Record 3 takes minimum per line — emotional variation across takes
- Combat barks: record at genuine physical exertion (actors should be standing, moving)
- Whispered lines recorded separately (not volume-reduced shouts)
- Fatigue progression: record lines at session end for naturally tired vocal quality (companion ambient remarks, late-game dialogue)

### Localization Considerations
- Primary language: English
- Dialogue system supports text localization with original English voice acting retained
- Character-specific non-English lines (Marta's Spanish, Yuki's Japanese, etc.) are NOT localized — they're character identity, not content delivery
- Lip sync: not required (no character face close-ups in art style — verify with art direction)

## Budget Prioritization

If budget requires cuts, reduce in this order (lowest impact first):

1. **Cut secondary NPC voiced lines** — convert to text + effort sounds (~700 lines saved)
2. **Reduce ambient vocal fragment pool** — fewer variants, more reuse (~100 samples saved)
3. **Reduce companion ambient remarks** — fewer exploration comments per zone (~840 lines saved)
4. **Reduce combat bark variants** — fewer per character, more repetition acceptable (~300 lines saved)
5. **NEVER cut:** Boss dialogue, companion story/loyalty lines, moral choice scenes. These are the game's emotional core.
