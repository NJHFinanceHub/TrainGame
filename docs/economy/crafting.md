## Crafting Skill Integration

Crafting quality scales with the player's relevant stat:
- **Technical** stat affects weapon/tool quality (bonus durability)
- **Social** stat affects disguise quality (longer detection time)
- **Survival** stat affects consumable potency (bonus heal/duration)

Stat thresholds:
- Below 3: 10% chance of crafting failure (wastes half ingredients)
- 3-5: Standard output
- 6-8: +15% bonus effectiveness on crafted items
- 9-10: +25% bonus + chance of "Masterwork" quality (named item, unique property)
