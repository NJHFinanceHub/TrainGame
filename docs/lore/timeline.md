## Pre-Freeze Era

### 2024
- Joseph Wilford announces the **Snowpiercer Global Rail Project** — marketed as a luxury circumnavigation train on a privately funded worldwide track network.
- Wilford Industries begins construction of the Eternal Engine, a perpetual-motion power system. The public sees a marvel of engineering. Wilford sees a survival mechanism.
- Track construction begins simultaneously across six continents using automated boring and laying systems.

### 2025
- Global climate crisis intensifies. Category 6 hurricanes strike the Atlantic basin three times in one season.
- Wilford Industries quietly begins internal modeling of geoengineering failure scenarios. Results are classified.
- First Class ticket sales open for Snowpiercer. $500,000 per berth. Sold out within two weeks.

### 2026
- The CW-7 consortium publishes initial research on atmospheric cooling agents. Wilford Industries is a listed contractor.
- Second Class recruitment begins — doctors, engineers, teachers, scientists selected for the "maiden voyage."
- Wilford privately commissions the construction of **Big Alice**, a smaller resupply train, at a separate facility.

### 2027
- CW-7 limited Arctic test deployment. Results declared "within parameters." Wilford's private models identify the feedback loop risk.
- Third Class worker recruitment begins. Mechanics, electricians, plumbers, cooks — anyone with essential manual skills.
- Snowpiercer's track network reaches 75% completion. Estimated completion: early 2031.

### 2028
- Global crop failures trigger famine across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Climate refugees exceed 400 million.
- Wilford accelerates Snowpiercer's internal systems: atmospheric processors, water recycling, hydroponic bays, protein cultivation farms. These are not luxury amenities.
- Big Alice construction completes. It is moved to a secret siding near the main track junction.

### 2029
- CW-7 Arctic deployment achieves target cooling. Consortium declares the technology ready for global scale.
- Wilford begins stockpiling supplies aboard Snowpiercer under the guise of "maiden voyage provisioning."
- Track network reaches 95% completion. Final segments in the Andean tunnels and Trans-Siberian corridor.

### 2030
- Sixty-seven nations sign the **Helsinki Accord**, authorizing full atmospheric CW-7 deployment.
- Wilford completes Snowpiercer. 1,034 cars. Self-sustaining for decades. He announces a departure date of September 2031 from Vladivostok.
- The passenger manifest is finalized: approximately 2,500 ticketed passengers across First, Second, and Third Class.

### 2031

**March 14:** CW-7 deployed globally. Seven hundred aircraft disperse the compound across both hemispheres.

**March 21:** Global temperatures drop 4°C in one week. Emergency declarations worldwide.

**April:** Rivers freeze. Agriculture collapses. Power grids fail. The compound self-catalyzes.

**May:** Oceans begin surface freezing. Shipping halts. Governments declare martial law.

**June:** Surface temperatures drop 30°C below baseline. Outdoor survival becomes impossible at most latitudes. Civilization functionally ends.

**July–August:** Die-off. Billions perish from cold, starvation, and violence. Governments collapse. Communication infrastructure fails.

**September 15 — BOARDING DAY:**
- Snowpiercer departs Vladivostok at 14:32 local time.
- 2,500 ticketed passengers board as planned.
- ~700 refugees storm the rear of the train and are sealed inside when Wilford orders departure.
- Total passenger count: ~3,200.
- The Tail is born.
- **The freeze does not stop.**

## Year 1 (2031–2032) — The Dark Time

**Circuit 1** (238 days)

### Months 1–3: The Starving
- Wilford provides no food to the Tail. His stated rationale: the train's ecosystem was not designed for the additional population. Resources must be rationed for the manifest.
- The Tail descends into starvation. The weak die first — the elderly, the sick, the very young.
- **The Dark Time begins.** When food runs out entirely, some Tailies turn to cannibalism. The strong prey on the weak. Children are targets. This period lasts approximately six weeks.
- **Gilliam's Sacrifice:** Gilliam offers his arm to feed others. The act — whether literal or mythologized — establishes him as the Tail's moral authority.
- An estimated 60 people die in the first three months from starvation, violence, and disease.

### Months 3–6: Protein Blocks
- Wilford begins sending protein blocks to the Tail — processed insect protein, nutritionally adequate, psychologically devastating.
- The blocks contain a mild sedative. This is not discovered for years.
- Cannibalism ends. Violence decreases. A fragile order emerges.
- **The first Jackboot patrols** of the Tail begin. Daily headcounts. Confiscation of tools. Enforcement of a boundary at Car 15.

### Months 6–12: The Sorting
- Social structures form in the Tail. Gilliam organizes the first Council — informal, but functional.
- The Listening Post concept emerges: Tailies press ears to walls and floors, mapping the train by sound.
- First Class settles into luxury. The aquarium is stocked. The sushi bar opens. The disconnect is total.
- Total Year 1 deaths in the Tail: ~120. Population drops from ~700 to ~580.
- **Big Alice** departs its hidden siding and connects to the main track network, running independently on a parallel routing schedule.

---

## Year 2 (2032–2033) — The Formation

**Circuits 2–3**

- The Council of Five formalizes. Gilliam (Head), Martha (Logistics), Samuel (Security), Asha (Medical), Reza (Community).
- The Workshop is established in Car 7 — hidden behind false walls. Scrap metal weapons production begins secretly.
- The Nursery in Car 4 becomes the Tail's center for children. Josie takes charge.
- The Protein Kitchen in Car 2 is organized under Old Maggie's direction.
- The Pit in Car 3 evolves from uncontrolled violence into a structured outlet. Grey becomes Pit Master.
- Wilford establishes the **Order of the Engine** — a religious framework venerating the Eternal Engine as divine. Mandatory worship services begin in Second Class. The ideology filters forward and back.
- **First children born in the Tail.** They will never know the outside world.

---

## Year 3 (2033–2034) — The First Revolt

**Circuits 4–5**

### The March of the Sixty
- **Leader: Thomas Creed** — a former construction foreman who boarded in the rush. Charismatic, physical, impatient.
- **Cause:** Protein rations cut by 30% without explanation. Two children dead from malnutrition in a single week.
- **Plan:** Mass frontal assault through Cars 9–15, overwhelming the Jackboot garrison with numbers.
- **Force:** 60 fighters armed with pipe weapons and improvised shields.
- **How far they got:** Car 14. Creed's force broke through the Blockade at Car 9, losing 12 fighters. They pushed through the Dark Car (then simply a powered-down storage car, not yet inhabited by the Forgotten). They reached Car 14 — two cars from the border.
- **Why it failed:** Wilford had been warned. Gilliam's "source in the front" — a communication channel that Gilliam believed was a sympathetic insider, but which was actually Wilford himself feeding strategic information — had tipped the forward sections. A full Jackboot company was waiting at Car 14 with riot shields, shock lances, and tear gas.
- **The Massacre:** 74 Tailies died. Creed was killed. The survivors were driven back to the Tail at lance-point. Wilford ordered the bodies left in Car 14 as a warning for three full circuits before allowing them to be collected.
- **The Evidence:** Car 14 is renamed **The Martyr's Gate**. Blood stains remain in the floor seams. Creed's pipe wrench — his weapon — is mounted on the wall. A hand-scratched mural lists every name of the fallen.
- **Aftermath:** Protein rations are restored to previous levels. Wilford's message is clear: revolt is permitted to fail. It is not permitted to succeed.

---

## Year 5 (2035–2036) — The Second Revolt

**Circuits 7–8**

### The Undercarriage Run
- **Leader: Kazuo "Kaz" Tanaka** — a former tunnel engineer. Quiet, methodical, brilliant.
- **Cause:** Children began disappearing. Taken forward for "apprenticeships." None returned. Kaz's daughter was among them.
- **Plan:** Avoid the interior entirely. Send a small team through the undercarriage maintenance crawlspaces — the narrow channels beneath the train floor used for mechanical access. Bypass the Blockade, the Dark Car, everything. Emerge in Third Class and open the doors from the other side.
- **Force:** 8 volunteers. Chosen for small build and technical skill.
- **How far they got:** Car 22. Kaz's team navigated the undercarriage for seven cars — a feat of endurance in near-freezing, pitch-dark crawlspaces with no room to stand. They emerged in Car 22 (Sanitation Systems) and spent two days hiding among the pipes, gathering intelligence.
- **Why it failed:** The tracking bracelets. Third Class workers wore monitoring devices that Kaz hadn't known about. When his team moved through a checkpoint without bracelets, an alarm triggered. Jackboots sealed the section. Three of Kaz's team were captured. Two were killed. Kaz and two others retreated back through the undercarriage.
- **The Retreat:** Rather than return to the Tail (where the Jackboots expected them), Kaz and his surviving team hid in the Dark Car — Car 10, which had lost power during the first revolt and never been repaired. They chose to disappear rather than be captured.
- **The Evidence:** The undercarriage crawlspaces still show scratched directional arrows from Kaz's team. In Car 22, maintenance workers sometimes find a faded chalk mark — Kaz's signal to his team — that no one has been able to fully remove.
- **Aftermath:** Wilford powers down Car 10 permanently, declaring it "structurally compromised." The Forgotten — Kaz's people and those who joined them over the years — establish a feral community in the darkness. The undercarriage access points in the Tail are welded shut. Kaz is never seen again, though the Forgotten claim he still lives.

## Year 8 (2038–2039) — The Third Revolt

**Circuits 12–13**

### The Poison Plot
- **Leader: Dr. Irena Volkov** — a chemist. Former Second Class, demoted to the Tail for "ideological non-compliance" (she questioned Wilford's resource allocation publicly).
- **Cause:** The Cough — a respiratory illness — appeared in the Tail. Asha requested medicine from the Medical Bay. Wilford's response: "The Tail's health is the Tail's responsibility."
- **Plan:** No frontal assault. No undercarriage. Irena proposed a targeted poisoning — contaminate the protein blocks sent to Jackboot barracks with a paralytic compound synthesized from industrial chemicals available in the Tail.
- **Force:** 4 people. Irena, two lab assistants, and a Kitchen worker who could access the distribution system.
- **How far they got:** The plan was executed successfully. Thirty Jackboots consumed contaminated rations. Twelve were incapacitated. The Tail's fighters prepared to move.
- **Why it failed:** Betrayal. Samuel — then a young fighter on the Council — opposed the plan on principle. He believed poison was cowardice, that revolution required open combat. He did not betray Irena to Wilford. What he did was worse: he told the fighters to ignore the poisoning window and prepare for a "real" assault. By the time they were ready, Wilford had identified the contamination, administered antidotes, and reinforced Car 15.
- **The Evidence:** Irena was taken forward. Her lab — a hidden corner of Car 6 — was dismantled. But her notes survive, hidden in the walls of the Sickbay. They include the paralytic formula — still viable, if the player finds them.
- **Aftermath:** Wilford institutes food testing for all Jackboot rations. The Kitchen is placed under closer surveillance. Samuel's role in the failure is known only to Gilliam, who has never spoken of it. It is the secret that defines their relationship: Gilliam knows Samuel's idealism cost them their best chance. Samuel knows Gilliam knows.

## Year 12 (2042–2043) — The Fourth Revolt

**Circuits 19–20**

### The Signal Hack
- **Leader: "Sparks"** — a Tail-born teenager. The first generation to grow up entirely on the train. Real name unknown even to most Tailies.
- **Cause:** The Kronole trade had begun flowing to the Tail, and with it, information. Sparks intercepted a signal from the Comms Center (Zone 4) suggesting that an external radio contact had been made — someone was alive outside the train. Wilford suppressed the information.
- **Plan:** Sparks proposed hijacking the train's internal communication system from the Listening Post. Broadcast the truth — that the outside world might be survivable — to every car simultaneously. Let the population decide Wilford's fate.
- **Force:** 6 people. Sparks and five Listening Post technicians trained by Blind Yuri.
- **How far they got:** They succeeded in tapping the train's com backbone. For eleven seconds, Sparks' message broadcast to every speaker on Snowpiercer: *"The outside temperature at Latitude 43 was minus twelve degrees on the last pass. It was minus thirty-one the circuit before. The world is warming. Wilford knows. He is keeping you on this train."*
- **Why it failed:** Eleven seconds. The Order of the Engine's communication officers cut the feed. The message was declared a "Kronole-induced hallucination" by the Propaganda Studio. Most passengers in the forward sections dismissed it. In the Tail, it was taken seriously — but without proof, it was just another rumor.
- **The Evidence:** The tap point in Car 8 still exists, hidden behind a panel. Blind Yuri knows where it is. The recording — if it can be recovered from the train's communication logs — is proof that the signal was real. Sparks vanished after the broadcast. The Jackboots claim she was captured. No body was ever produced. Thaw believers insist she escaped into the maintenance tunnels and is still aboard somewhere.
- **Aftermath:** Wilford increases surveillance on the Listening Post. The com backbone is encrypted. But the damage is done: the idea that the world might be warming has entered the Tail's collective consciousness and cannot be removed. The Thaw movement dates its founding to Sparks' eleven-second broadcast.

## Year 13–16 (2043–2047) — The Pressure Builds

**Circuits 21–26**

- Protein rations decrease steadily. The insect colonies are failing — Wilford's closed ecosystem was designed for 2,500, not 3,200.
- The Cough becomes endemic in the Tail. Asha estimates 40% infection rate.
- Children continue disappearing. Josie's List — a record of every child taken forward — reaches 34 names.
- The Kronole trade intensifies. Raw chemical waste flows to the Tail; processed Kronole flows forward. Both sides profit. Neither side trusts the other.
- **Reza is taken forward** — the fifth Council seat vacated. The official reason: "reassignment." He is presumed dead.
- The Workshop accelerates weapon production. Anvil trains apprentices. The armory hidden behind the false walls of Car 7 grows.
- Gilliam's "source" begins sending more detailed information. Guard rotations. Door codes. Patrol timing. Gilliam suspects the information is too good — that he is being manipulated — but uses it anyway because the alternative is ignorance.
- Samuel, now middle-aged and hardened by decades of confinement, presses openly for revolt. The Council is split.
- **The player is born in Year 14.** Tail-born. Has never seen the sky, felt rain, or breathed unrecycled air. Has grown up on stories of the outside world and the names of the dead.

## Year 17 (2048) — The Game Begins

**Circuit 27 (current)**

### State of the Train

The revolution is not a question of if. It is a question of when, and who leads it.

- **Tail population:** ~300 (down from ~700 at boarding)
- **Total train population:** ~2,800 (down from ~3,200)
- **Protein rations:** At 60% of Year 2 levels. Hunger is constant.
- **The Cough:** Spreading. Asha projects 70% infection in six months without medicine.
- **Missing children:** 37 total since boarding. Most recent: Andy, three months ago.
- **Weapon stockpile:** 40+ improvised weapons in the Workshop. Enough for a serious assault.
- **Intelligence:** Gilliam has current guard rotations, door codes for Cars 9 and 15, and a partial map of Third Class. The information is from Wilford.
- **Morale:** A blade's edge. One more cut to rations, one more missing child, one more death from the Cough — and the Tail moves, with or without a plan.

### The Morning the Game Starts

The player wakes in a bunk in Car 1. It is protein distribution day. Gilliam has called a Council meeting for this evening. Samuel has been seen in the Workshop with Anvil.

Something is different today. The Jackboots didn't come for the morning count.

The revolution begins.
