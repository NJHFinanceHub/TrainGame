## Big Alice

### Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Big Alice (official: Wilford Industries Supply Unit Alpha) |
| **Length** | 40 cars |
| **Builder** | Wilford Industries, completed 2028 |
| **Purpose** | Resupply and emergency support for Snowpiercer |
| **Population** | ~200 (estimated, Year 17) |
| **Engine type** | Secondary Eternal Engine (smaller, less powerful) |
| **Track** | Shares Snowpiercer's global loop, runs on a parallel timing offset |
| **Current status** | Active. Last confirmed sighting: Circuit 25, Siberian Plateau |

### History

Big Alice was built in secret between 2026 and 2028 at a separate Wilford Industries facility in Kazakhstan. It was never announced publicly. Its existence is known only to Wilford's inner circle, the Cold Lab, and — through fragmentary intelligence — the Listening Post.

The train was designed as a resupply vessel: carrying replacement parts, seed stocks, chemical supplies, and emergency equipment. Its secondary Engine is a smaller version of Snowpiercer's Eternal Engine, capable of sustained independent operation but with significantly less power output.

**Boarding Day:** Big Alice departed its siding 48 hours after Snowpiercer, carrying approximately 150 Wilford Industries engineers and scientists — the team that built the train. They were the only people who knew it existed.

**Years 1–5:** Big Alice ran on the same global loop as Snowpiercer, offset by approximately 30 days. It rendezvoused with the main train twice per circuit at pre-arranged junction points. Resupply was conducted via automated coupling — the trains never stopped, only matched speed while supplies were transferred between cars.

**Years 6–10:** The rendezvous became irregular. Big Alice's population grew (births and a small number of refugees discovered in a surviving bunker complex in the Andes). Its own resource needs increased. Supply transfers decreased.

**Years 11–17:** Contact became sporadic. Big Alice has not rendezvoused with Snowpiercer in over two circuits. The Cold Lab's tracking systems (hull-mounted sensors that detect electromagnetic signatures from other trains on the network) confirm Big Alice is still running. Its location and heading are known. Its silence is not explained.

### What Big Alice Means for the Game

Big Alice is a narrative bomb. Its existence raises questions that reshape everything:

1. **Wilford has a backup.** If Snowpiercer's population becomes unmanageable — if, say, a revolution succeeds — Wilford could theoretically transfer to Big Alice and continue. The main train becomes disposable.

2. **There are other survivors.** The Andes bunker refugees prove that surface survival was possible in at least some locations, at least for some time. What else is out there?

3. **Contact is possible.** If the Comms Center (Zone 4) can reach Big Alice, the political dynamics of the train change entirely. An external ally — or an external threat.

4. **The Secret Ending.** Ending 6 ("The Bridge") involves establishing contact with Big Alice and discovering that its population has developed a radically different social model — one without classes. This ending requires the player to reach the Comms Center and broadcast on the correct frequency.

### Big Alice's Internal Society

Unknown to Snowpiercer's passengers, Big Alice evolved differently:

- **No class system.** With only 40 cars and ~200 people, the engineers who built the train created a functional democracy. Resources are shared equally. Labor is rotated.
- **Scientific focus.** Big Alice's population includes the team that designed CW-7's delivery system. They have spent seventeen years modeling the compound's degradation. Their projections are more optimistic than the Cold Lab's — they believe the freeze will end within 15–20 years.
- **Guilt.** Many of Big Alice's inhabitants carry responsibility for the freeze. They built the system that killed the world. Their society is oriented around atonement — finding a way to reverse or mitigate CW-7's effects.
- **They know about Snowpiercer's class system.** They have monitoring equipment that can intercept the main train's internal communications. They are horrified. They have debated intervention for years but lack the numbers to force change.

## The Question of Other Trains

### Known: None Confirmed Beyond Big Alice

Wilford's track network was built for one train (plus its supply unit). However:

- **The track exists globally.** 71,000 km of reinforced rail, built to last decades. Any vehicle that could run on it and generate its own power could theoretically operate.
- **Wilford Industries built other prototypes.** Internal documents (available in the Vault, Zone 6) reference three test vehicles built between 2024 and 2026 during the Eternal Engine's development. These were smaller units — 3 to 5 cars each — used for track testing. Their final disposition is not recorded.
- **The Comms Center has detected anomalous signals.** Twice in the past five years, the Comms Center picked up electromagnetic signatures on the track network that did not match either Snowpiercer or Big Alice. Both incidents were classified by Wilford and not investigated.

### Theories Aboard Snowpiercer

**The Solitary Theory (Official):** Snowpiercer is the last bastion of humanity. Big Alice is its support system. There is nothing else. This is what Wilford teaches, what the Order preaches, and what most passengers believe.

**The Fleet Theory (Underground):** Wilford built more trains. A fleet, perhaps, each carrying a different population, a different skill set, a different piece of civilization. This theory has no evidence but is popular among the Kronole Network, whose hallucinogenic products tend to inspire grandiose thinking.

**The Feral Train Theory (Listening Post):** The test prototypes survived the freeze and are running on the track network without crew — automated ghost trains, their engines still turning, their cars empty, circling the world forever. Blind Yuri claims to have heard one: a rhythmic sound, wrong frequency for Snowpiercer or Big Alice, detected during the Bering crossing four circuits ago.

**The Outside Theory (Thaw Believers):** Forget trains. There are people alive *outside*. Bunkers, caves, geothermal vents, equatorial zones where the freeze was less severe. The eleven-second broadcast mentioned temperature data suggesting the world is warming. If it's warming, surface survival becomes increasingly possible. The train may not be the only option — it may not even be the best one.

| Lore Element | Discoverable In | Quest Impact |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Big Alice's existence | Cold Lab (Zone 4), Archive (Zone 3) | Opens Ending 6 path |
| Big Alice's frequency | Comms Center (Zone 4) | Required for contact |
| Big Alice's social model | Comms Center data (Zone 4) | Dialogue options in Endings 2, 4, 6 |
| Test prototypes | Vault (Zone 6) | Lore-only, contextual |

Big Alice is not just a plot device — it's a mirror. Snowpiercer chose hierarchy. Big Alice chose equality. Both survived. The player, standing in the Engine Room at the end of the game, must decide which model is the future.
