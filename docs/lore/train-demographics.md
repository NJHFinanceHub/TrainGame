# Train Demographics

> Population data as of Year 17 (2048), Circuit 27. Figures are estimates based on census records maintained by the Bureaucracy (Second Class) and independent counts by the Tail Council.

## Total Population

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Current total population** | ~2,800 |
| **Boarding day total** | ~3,200 |
| **Total deaths (17 years)** | ~650 |
| **Total births (17 years)** | ~250 |

The train is slowly dying. The death rate has consistently exceeded the birth rate in every zone. Wilford's original ecosystem was designed to sustain 2,500 indefinitely — but it carries 2,800 at diminished capacity, and the insect colonies that underpin the food chain are degrading.

## Population by Zone

| Zone | Class | Boarding Pop. | Current Pop. | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Zone 1 | Tail | ~700 | ~300 | Highest attrition. No planned infrastructure. |
| Zone 2 | Third Class | ~800 | ~620 | Workers. Steady decline from accidents, punishment. |
| Zone 3 | Second Class | ~500 | ~450 | Professionals. Lowest death rate outside First. |
| Zone 4 | Working Spine | ~100 | ~80 | Engineers and technicians. Small, essential crew. |
| Zone 5 | First Class | ~350 | ~310 | Wealthy passengers. Lowest mortality, lowest birth rate. |
| Zone 6 | The Sanctum | ~50 | ~60 | Wilford's inner circle. Population grew through recruitment. |
| Zone 7 | The Engine | ~15 | ~20* | Engine crew. *Includes children (see below). |
| **Unzoned** | Various | ~685 | ~960 | Jackboots, Order clergy, Kronole Network, maintenance crews deployed across multiple zones |

*Note: "Unzoned" personnel are distributed throughout the train and do not belong to a single zone's census. The Jackboot force numbers approximately 400. The Order of the Engine maintains ~80 clergy across zones. Maintenance and infrastructure crews total ~200. The Kronole Network's membership is unknown.*

## Zone 1: The Tail — Detailed Demographics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **Total population** | ~300 |
| **Adult men** | ~110 |
| **Adult women** | ~105 |
| **Children (under 16)** | ~55 |
| **Elderly (over 60)** | ~30 |

### Age Distribution
- **0–5 (Tail-born, youngest):** ~15
- **6–15 (Tail-born, youth):** ~40
- **16–30 (Tail-born, young adult):** ~70 (the player's cohort)
- **31–50 (Boarded as adults):** ~100
- **51–65 (Core generation):** ~55
- **65+ (Elderly Core):** ~20

### Birth and Death Rates (Tail)
- **Annual births:** ~8–12
- **Annual deaths:** ~20–30
- **Net population change:** -10 to -20 per year
- **Primary causes of death:** Malnutrition-related illness (35%), the Cough (25%), violence (15%), hypothermia from hull breaches (10%), taken forward and presumed dead (10%), other (5%)
- **Infant mortality:** ~20% (no incubators, limited medicine, poor nutrition)

### Fertility
Birth rates in the Tail are suppressed by:
- **Malnutrition:** Chronic caloric deficit reduces fertility in both sexes.
- **The sedative in protein blocks:** Long-term hormonal effects suspected but unconfirmed.
- **Social pressure:** The Council discourages large families — there isn't enough food. This is a guideline, not a rule, and is frequently ignored.
- **Lack of privacy:** Difficult to achieve in bunks stacked four-high with blanket partitions.

Despite this, the Tail-born generation is the largest age cohort. They are the revolution's foot soldiers.

## Forward Sections — Key Demographics

### Third Class (Zone 2)
- **Population:** ~620
- **Composition:** Workers and their families. Mechanics, cleaners, cooks, laborers.
- **Birth rate:** Higher than Tail (better nutrition), ~15–18 per year.
- **Death rate:** ~12–15 per year. Workplace accidents are the leading cause.
- **Key fact:** Third Class is where demotions land. Former Second Class residents who angered the Bureaucracy are sent here. Former Third Class who angered the Jackboots are sent to the Tail.

### Second Class (Zone 3)
- **Population:** ~450
- **Composition:** Professionals. Doctors, teachers, administrators, technicians, clergy.
- **Birth rate:** Moderate, ~8–10 per year. Controlled by social expectation and contraceptive access.
- **Death rate:** Low, ~5–8 per year. Best medical access after First Class.
- **Key fact:** Second Class is the political center of the train. The Bureaucracy, the School Car, the Surveillance Hub, and the Print Shop are all here. Information is the currency.

### First Class (Zone 5)
- **Population:** ~310
- **Composition:** Original ticket holders and their descendants. The wealthy.
- **Birth rate:** Low, ~3–5 per year. Small families are the norm. Children are raised by nannies (Third Class workers assigned to First).
- **Death rate:** Very low, ~3–5 per year. Mostly age-related. The best food, medicine, and living conditions on the train.
- **Key fact:** First Class has the highest average age on the train. Many original boarders are still alive. They remember the old world and mourn it — with sushi and champagne.

## The Jackboots

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Total force** | ~400 |
| **Active combat** | ~250 |
| **Support/admin** | ~100 |
| **Training/cadets** | ~50 |
| **Recruitment** | Third Class conscription (mandatory 2-year service, most stay) |
| **Average age** | 28 |
| **Mortality rate** | Highest of any group. Combat, revolt suppression, undercarriage patrols. |

The Jackboots are not a homogeneous force. Many are reluctant conscripts from Third Class who saw no other path to better rations. Others are true believers in Wilford's order. A few are sadists who found their calling. The distinction matters — some can be turned.

## The Missing Children

A persistent demographic anomaly tracked by both the Tail Council and, secretly, by the Bureaucracy:

| Year Range | Children Taken Forward | Returned |
|------------|----------------------|----------|
| Years 1–5 | 8 | 0 |
| Years 6–10 | 11 | 0 |
| Years 11–17 | 18 | 0 |
| **Total** | **37** | **0** |

Children are taken from the Tail and Third Class under the pretense of "apprenticeships" or "educational reassignment." None have returned. None have been seen in any forward section by anyone who would report it.

The truth — that they are used as small-bodied laborers in the Engine's maintenance spaces, replacing worn components that adult hands cannot reach — is the game's most devastating revelation.

## Population Projections

The Cold Lab maintains population models (classified, available in the Archive):

**Optimistic scenario (current resource levels maintained):**
- Year 20: ~2,500
- Year 25: ~2,100
- Year 30: ~1,600
- Year 50: ~500

**Pessimistic scenario (insect colony failure accelerates):**
- Year 20: ~2,200
- Year 25: ~1,500
- Year 30: ~800
- Year 50: Extinction

**Wilford's scenario (classified, found in the Vault):**
- Wilford's own models assume a "managed reduction" to ~1,500 through attrition, after which the ecosystem stabilizes indefinitely.
- The Tail is not included in this stable population.
- Neither is most of Third Class.

The train is an ark. But not everyone is meant to reach the other side.
