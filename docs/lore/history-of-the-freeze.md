## The World Before

By 2028, global warming had become undeniable catastrophe. Superstorms battered coastlines. Crop failures cascaded across continents. Climate refugees numbered in the hundreds of millions. The world's governments, paralyzed by decades of inaction, turned in desperation to geoengineering — the deliberate manipulation of the planet's climate systems.

The leading proposal came from a consortium of climate scientists and defense contractors: **CW-7**, a cooling agent designed to be dispersed in the upper atmosphere. The compound — a crystalline aerosol engineered to reflect solar radiation back into space — was tested in limited quantities over the Arctic in 2029 with promising results. Global temperatures dropped 0.3°C in the test zone within weeks. The consortium declared success. Governments rushed to scale.

On **March 14, 2031**, sixty-seven nations simultaneously authorized the full atmospheric deployment of CW-7. Seven hundred aircraft released the compound across both hemispheres in a coordinated operation lasting forty-eight hours. The effect was immediate and catastrophic.

CW-7 performed exactly as designed. The problem was that it worked too well — and it wouldn't stop working.

## The Descent

Within the first week, global average temperatures dropped 4°C. Within the first month, 12°C. The compound proved self-catalyzing: once dispersed, it triggered a chain reaction in the upper atmosphere, converting water vapor into additional reflective crystals. The feedback loop was unstoppable.

**Week 1 (March 2031):** Temperatures plummet. Equatorial regions experience their first frost. Panic buying empties stores worldwide.

**Month 1 (April 2031):** Major rivers freeze. The Nile. The Amazon. The Ganges. Agricultural collapse begins. Power grids fail as demand for heating overwhelms infrastructure. The first mass migrations begin — but there is nowhere warm to go.

**Month 2 (May 2031):** Oceans begin surface freezing at latitudes above 40°. Shipping halts. Supply chains disintegrate. Governments declare martial law. The CW-7 consortium publishes a retraction paper that no one reads. Several of its lead scientists die by suicide.

**Month 3 (June 2031):** Global average temperature has dropped 30°C below pre-deployment baseline. The concept of "summer" ceases to exist. Surface temperature at the equator averages -15°C. At higher latitudes: -40°C to -70°C. Exposed human survival time outdoors drops below thirty minutes in most of the world. Civilization, as a functioning system, ends.

**Month 6 (September 2031):** The freeze stabilizes. Not because CW-7 stops working, but because there is little atmospheric moisture left to convert. The planet is locked in a new ice age — one that was supposed to cool the world by 2°C. It cooled it by 40.

The last satellite telemetry before ground stations failed showed a planet sheathed in white. No green. No blue. Only white, from pole to pole.

## The Death of Nations

No government survived the freeze intact. Some lasted weeks. A few lasted months. The United States fractured into regional survival zones that collapsed one by one as fuel ran out. China's centralized response held longest — three months of organized retreat into underground bunker complexes — before communication ceased. Russia's population, accustomed to cold, lasted slightly longer on the surface, but -60°C is not survivable in any sustained way, even for Siberians.

The total pre-freeze human population was approximately 9.2 billion. By the best estimates available — and these are guesses, compiled years later from fragmentary radio intercepts and the observations of train passengers who witnessed the early weeks — fewer than 200,000 people survived the first year. Most of those were in sealed environments: military bunkers, research stations, underground facilities.

Of those, most are presumed to have died when their supplies ran out.

By Year 5 of the freeze, the only confirmed surviving human population was aboard Snowpiercer and, later, the supply train Big Alice. Approximately 3,200 souls — all that remained of a species that had numbered billions.

## What CW-7 Was

The compound itself was not a single chemical but a suite of engineered nanoparticles designed to:

1. **Reflect solar radiation** at specific wavelengths (primary function)
2. **Self-replicate** using atmospheric water vapor as a substrate (intended to extend coverage without re-deployment)
3. **Resist degradation** from UV exposure and atmospheric chemistry (intended to ensure longevity)

Properties 2 and 3 were the catastrophe. The self-replication made the effect uncontrollable. The UV resistance meant the compound would persist for decades — possibly centuries — before natural degradation reduced its concentration enough to allow warming.

Current models (maintained by the Cold Lab in the Working Spine, Zone 4) project that CW-7 concentrations will drop below the critical threshold for sustained deep freeze in approximately 30-50 years from deployment. Some models suggest sooner. Some suggest never. The uncertainty is the cruelest part.

## The Question of Intent

Was CW-7 a mistake or a weapon? This question has fueled conspiracy theories aboard Snowpiercer for seventeen years.

**The Mistake Theory (Official):** CW-7 was a well-intentioned geoengineering solution that failed catastrophically due to the self-replication mechanism behaving unpredictably at scale. The consortium's models failed to account for the catalytic feedback loop. This is the explanation favored by the Bureaucracy and taught in the School Car.

**The Weapon Theory (Underground):** CW-7 was deliberately designed to cause the freeze, either as a population reduction scheme or as a means to consolidate power. Proponents note that Wilford Industries was a major contractor in the CW-7 consortium and that Snowpiercer was suspiciously well-prepared for exactly this scenario. This theory is popular in the Tail and among the Kronole Network.

**The Wilford Theory (Classified):** Available only in the Archive (Zone 3) and the Vault (Zone 6), certain documents suggest a third possibility — that Wilford knew CW-7 would fail, not because he caused it, but because his own climate models predicted the feedback loop. Rather than warn the world, he used the lead time to complete Snowpiercer's construction and secure his position as humanity's savior. He didn't cause the freeze. He simply chose not to prevent it.

The truth — whatever it is — lies somewhere in the Engine.

## The Train

### Wilford's Ark

Joseph Wilford began designing Snowpiercer in 2024, seven years before the freeze. At the time, he presented it as a luxury circumnavigation train — "the world's greatest rail journey," an engineering marvel that would circle the globe on a privately funded track network.

This was a lie. Or at best, a half-truth.

Wilford was already modeling worst-case climate scenarios. His private research division — funded through Wilford Industries' defense contracts — had identified the CW-7 feedback risk eighteen months before the consortium's public deployment. Whether he tried to warn anyone is disputed. What is not disputed is that he used that time.

The Eternal Engine — the perpetual-motion power plant at the heart of Snowpiercer — was not designed for a luxury train. It was designed for indefinite operation without fuel resupply. The water recycling, atmospheric processing, and food production systems were not amenities — they were survival infrastructure. The track network, funded as a vanity project, was engineered to withstand extreme cold, seismic shifts, and decades of unmaintained operation.

Wilford built an ark. He told the world it was a cruise ship.

### The Boarding

**September 15, 2031** — six months after CW-7 deployment. The world was dying. Wilford announced Snowpiercer's departure from its terminal in Vladivostok, Russia.

Tickets had been sold years in advance to the wealthy. First Class: private suites, restaurants, entertainment. Second Class: professional quarters, essential services. Third Class: worker dormitories, manual labor assignments. The manifest was complete. The train was full.

Then the crowds came.

Thousands of refugees, drawn by the rumor of a warm train, descended on the Vladivostok terminal. They overwhelmed the Jackboot security perimeter and stormed the rear of the train. The rearmost cars — cargo containers, equipment storage, maintenance bays — filled with desperate people in minutes.

Wilford had a choice: delay departure to remove them (risking the scheduled track window and the advancing freeze), or seal the doors and go.

He sealed the doors. Snowpiercer departed at 14:32 local time with approximately 3,200 passengers — 700 more than planned. The unplanned 700 became the Tail.

### The First Circuit

The train's maiden voyage was chaos. The Tail had no food, no water distribution, no sanitation, no heating beyond body warmth. The forward sections had no plan for the additional population. Wilford's initial response was to ignore the Tail entirely — a problem that would, he assumed, resolve itself.

It didn't resolve itself. It got worse.

The first three months saw the Tail descend into what survivors call **the Dark Time**. Starvation drove people to cannibalism. The strong preyed on the weak. Children were targeted. Gilliam — then a middle-aged man who had boarded with nothing but the clothes on his back — made the sacrifice that would define his legend: he offered his own arm to feed others. Whether this is literally true or a mythologized version of a more complex event is debated, but the result is not — Gilliam emerged from the Dark Time as the Tail's moral authority.

After three months, Wilford began sending protein blocks to the Tail. The blocks — processed from insect colonies cultivated in the industrial cars — were nutritionally adequate and aesthetically revolting. They were also, as some Tailies would later discover, laced with a mild sedative to reduce aggression.

The protein blocks ended the cannibalism. They did not end the suffering.

## Seventeen Years on the Rails

The game begins in **Year 17** of the freeze — **2048** by the old calendar, though few aboard Snowpiercer use it anymore. Time is measured in circuits: the train has completed approximately **26 full circuits** of its global track, each taking roughly 238 days.

Seventeen years of motion. Seventeen years of a sealed ecosystem. Seventeen years of class warfare conducted at 80 kilometers per hour.

The freeze has not relented. If anything, it has deepened. The Cold Lab's most recent measurements (taken through hull sensors during the Siberian Plateau crossing) show surface temperatures averaging -67°C, with wind chill factors making exposed survival time less than five minutes.

And yet — there are anomalies. A temperature spike during the most recent Oceanic Bridge crossing. Ice that seemed thinner than the previous circuit. A bird — or something that looked like a bird — spotted through an observation window in the Andean tunnel approach.

The Thaw believers whisper that the world is waking up. The Order of the Engine calls such talk heresy. The Cold Lab publishes no findings without Wilford's approval.

Somewhere in the back of the train, in a car stacked with bunks four-high, a person who has never seen the sun is sharpening a weapon made from a pipe.

The revolution is coming. Again.
