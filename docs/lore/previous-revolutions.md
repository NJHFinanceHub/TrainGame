## Overview

Every revolution aboard Snowpiercer has taught the Tail something. Every failure has left physical evidence in the cars — bloodstains, graffiti, hidden caches, structural damage. The train remembers what happened even when the people try to forget.

| 1 | Y3 | The March of the Sixty | Thomas Creed | Car 14 | 74 | Massacre at Martyr's Gate |
| 2 | Y5 | The Undercarriage Run | Kazuo "Kaz" Tanaka | Car 22 | 5 | Retreat; birth of the Forgotten |

## Revolution 1: The March of the Sixty (Year 3)

### Context
The freeze was three years old. The Tail's population was ~500, down from ~700. Protein rations — already inadequate — were cut by 30% without explanation. Two children died from malnutrition in a single week. The Dark Time was still raw memory. The Tail had formed basic social structures but no formal Council. Leadership was informal, contested, and desperate.

### The Leader: Thomas Creed
- **Background:** Former construction foreman, age 41. Boarded in the rush. Big man — 6'3", broad-shouldered, commanding voice. Had organized work crews before the freeze and naturally organized fighters after it.
- **Philosophy:** Direct action. Creed believed the only language Wilford understood was force. Numbers would overwhelm the garrison. The Tail had 500 people; the Jackboots had maybe 50 assigned to the rear. Simple math.
- **Fatal flaw:** No intelligence. Creed didn't know what lay beyond Car 15. He didn't know the Jackboot numbers forward. He didn't know about Wilford's surveillance. He led with courage and nothing else.

### The Plan
Mass frontal assault. Every able-bodied Tailie would charge forward through the cars. The first wave — 60 fighters with pipe weapons and improvised shields — would break the Blockade at Car 9. The rest would follow.

### The Assault (Day 1, Morning)
**0600:** The morning count. Jackboots enter the Tail as usual. Creed's fighters attack. Eight Jackboots overwhelmed and disarmed. First blood.

**0620:** Creed's sixty push into Car 9 — the Blockade. Twelve Jackboots with riot shields form a wall across the car's width. The corridor is 3.2 meters wide. Combat is brutal, close-quarters, and loud. Creed personally breaks the line. Twelve Tailies die. All twelve Jackboots are killed or incapacitated.

**0700:** Cars 10 and 11 are crossed. Car 10 is a powered-down storage car (not yet the Dark Car). Car 11's hull breach already exists — two fighters die from cold exposure.

**0730:** Cars 12 and 13 are passed through quickly. No significant resistance.

**0800:** Creed's force reaches Car 14 — two cars from the border. They are down to 40 fighters.

### The Massacre (Day 1, 0815)
A full Jackboot company — 60 soldiers with shock lances, riot shields, tear gas, and body armor — is waiting. They fill the car from wall to wall, three rows deep. Behind them, the sealed blast door to Car 15.

Wilford had been warned. The information came through a channel that Gilliam would later inherit: the "source in the front." At this point, the source was genuinely Wilford's agent — a surveillance system, not a negotiation.

The Tailies charge. The Jackboots hold. Gas fills the car. Shock lances arc. The Tailies, unarmored, malnourished, fighting with pipes against professional soldiers, are cut down.

74 Tailies die. Thomas Creed is among them — killed by a shock lance to the chest at close range. The survivors — six — are driven back through the cars at lance-point, stepping over their own dead.

### Aftermath
- Wilford orders the bodies left in Car 14 for three full circuits (~714 days). The car becomes a charnel house. When the bodies are finally collected, they are composted in Third Class sanitation. The blood stains remain.
- Car 14 is renamed **The Martyr's Gate.** Creed's pipe wrench — his weapon — is mounted on the wall by Tailies who sneak forward to honor the dead.
- A hand-scratched mural listing all 74 names is carved into the wall. It is never defaced, not even by Jackboots.
- Protein rations are restored to previous levels. The cut was a provocation — Wilford wanted a revolt to fail, to teach the Tail that resistance is death.

### Physical Evidence (Discoverable in Game)
- Blood stains in floor seams of Car 14
- Creed's pipe wrench on the wall
- The 74 names scratched into metal
- Faded tear gas residue on the ceiling
- Dents in the walls from bodies hitting steel

## Revolution 2: The Undercarriage Run (Year 5)

### Context
Two years after the March. The Tail has formed the Council of Five under Gilliam. Children have begun disappearing — taken forward for "apprenticeships." Kaz Tanaka's daughter, Yuki, was taken six months ago. He has heard nothing since.

### The Leader: Kazuo "Kaz" Tanaka
- **Background:** Former tunnel engineer, age 38. Japanese-Brazilian. Small, wiry, methodical. Had worked on the Andean tunnel segment of Wilford's track network before being laid off. Boarded in the rush.
- **Philosophy:** Intelligence over force. Creed proved that frontal assault fails. The train is a machine — machines have maintenance access. Find the crawlspaces. Bypass everything.
- **Fatal flaw:** Incomplete intelligence. Kaz knew the undercarriage existed but didn't know about Third Class tracking bracelets. One unknown variable killed the operation.

### The Plan
Send eight volunteers through the undercarriage maintenance crawlspaces — the narrow channels beneath the train floor used for mechanical access. The passages are 0.7 meters high, unheated, and run the full length of the train. A small, skilled team could bypass every car, emerge in Third Class, and open the secured doors from the other side.

### The Team
Eight volunteers, selected for small build and technical skill:
1. Kaz Tanaka (leader)
2. Mira (Kaz's partner, engineer)
3. Jun (electrician, smallest person in the Tail)
4. Petra (former plumber, knew pipe systems)
5. Davi (teenager, recruited for size)
6. Lena (teenager, recruited for size)
7. Oscar (mechanic)
8. Fenn (scout, good in dark spaces)

### The Run (Day 1, Night)
**2200:** Team enters the undercarriage through an access hatch in Car 7 (the Workshop, where the hatch was concealed behind false walls).

**2200–0400:** Six hours of crawling through near-freezing, pitch-dark passages. No room to stand. Steel beneath and above. The sound of the track inches away. Wind screams through gaps in the undercarriage shielding. Kaz navigates by counting rivets and reading chalk marks he leaves behind.

**0400:** Team emerges in Car 22 — Sanitation Systems, Third Class. They hide among the pipes and sewage processing equipment.

### Discovery (Day 3)
For two days, Kaz's team hides in Car 22, observing Third Class routines and gathering intelligence. On the third day, they attempt to move through a checkpoint toward the Third Class border.

The tracking bracelets. Every Third Class worker wears a monitoring device — a thin band on the wrist that pings location data to the Surveillance Hub (Zone 3). Kaz's team has no bracelets. When they pass a checkpoint sensor, the system registers eight untracked individuals in a restricted corridor.

The alarm is instant. Jackboots seal the section in ninety seconds.

### The Retreat
**Casualties:** Three captured (Jun, Petra, Davi). Two killed during the retreat (Oscar, Fenn — shot while entering the undercarriage hatch). Kaz, Mira, and Lena escape back into the crawlspaces.

Rather than return to the Tail — where Jackboots will be waiting — Kaz leads his two survivors into Car 10, the powered-down storage car. They choose to disappear.

### The Birth of the Forgotten
Over the following years, Kaz, Mira, and Lena are joined by others: Tailies who can't bear the Tail, runaways from Third Class, deserters from the Jackboots. By Year 17, the Forgotten number approximately 20 people living in total darkness in Car 10.

Kaz may or may not still be alive. The Forgotten do not answer questions about their leadership. Mira is occasionally glimpsed at the edges of the Dark Car. Lena, now in her late twenties, is their primary contact with the outside — and she trusts no one.

### Aftermath
- Wilford powers down Car 10 permanently, officially citing "structural compromise." In reality, he finds the Forgotten useful — they discourage casual movement between the Tail and the Blockade.
- The undercarriage access hatches in the Tail are welded shut. The Workshop's hidden hatch survives because the Jackboots never found it.
- The three captured team members are never seen again. Their fate is unknown (the player can discover it in Zone 7).

### Physical Evidence (Discoverable in Game)
- Chalk directional arrows in the undercarriage crawlspaces
- A faded chalk mark in Car 22 (Kaz's signal)
- The welded-shut hatches in the Tail (Car 3, Car 5 — visible as smooth weld scars)
- The Workshop's hidden hatch (Car 7 — still functional)
- Scratched names of the team on a pipe in the undercarriage

## Revolution 3: The Poison Plot (Year 8)

### Context
The Cough has appeared in the Tail — a respiratory illness that will become endemic. Asha (Council Medical) requests medicine from the forward sections. Wilford's response: "The Tail's health is the Tail's responsibility." Thirty Tailies have died from the Cough in six months.

### The Leader: Dr. Irena Volkov
- **Background:** Chemist, age 45. Originally Second Class — a researcher in the Cold Lab. Demoted to the Tail in Year 6 for publishing a paper questioning Wilford's resource allocation model. Brilliant, bitter, and methodical.
- **Philosophy:** Asymmetric warfare. The Tail cannot win a fight. It can win a poisoning. Target the Jackboots' food supply. Incapacitate the garrison. Walk through the open doors.
- **Fatal flaw:** Trusted the wrong ally. Samuel's idealism — his insistence that revolution must be "honorable" — destroyed the operation.

### The Plan
Synthesize a paralytic compound from industrial chemicals available in the Tail (cleaning solvents, machine lubricants, protein block processing byproducts). Introduce the compound into the protein blocks sent to the Jackboot garrison in Car 9. When the garrison is incapacitated, the Tail's fighters advance.

### Execution
**Month 1:** Irena synthesizes the compound in a hidden corner of Car 6 (the Sickbay). The compound causes progressive muscle paralysis — non-lethal, full effect in 4–6 hours, recovery in 24–48 hours.

**Month 2:** A Kitchen worker (name redacted — still alive in Year 17, identity protected) gains access to the Jackboot ration distribution system. The compound is introduced.

**Day of Action:** 30 Jackboots consume contaminated rations. Within four hours, 12 are fully incapacitated. The remainder experience reduced motor function. The Car 9 garrison is at 40% effectiveness.

### The Betrayal
Samuel — then a young fighter, not yet on the Council — learns of the plan and objects. Not to Wilford. Not even to Gilliam. He objects to *the Tail's fighters*. He tells them that poison is cowardice. That a revolution won by treachery will be governed by treachery. That they should wait and prepare for a "real" assault — one fought face to face.

The fighters listen. Not all of them, but enough. The assault force, which should have moved within the hour, delays while Samuel argues for a different approach. By the time a compromise is reached — twelve hours later — Wilford's medical team has identified the contamination, administered antidotes, and reinforced Car 15.

The window closes. Irena's plan — which had worked perfectly — is wasted.

### Aftermath
- Irena is identified through Jackboot investigation (the Kitchen worker did not break, but surveillance footage narrows the suspects). She is taken forward. Her fate is unknown.
- Her lab is dismantled. But her notes — including the paralytic formula — survive, hidden in the walls of Car 6. They are still there.
- Wilford institutes food testing for all Jackboot rations. The Kitchen is placed under closer surveillance.
- Samuel's role in the failure is known only to Gilliam. It is the secret that poisons their relationship: Gilliam knows Samuel's pride cost them their best chance. Samuel knows Gilliam knows. Neither speaks of it.
- Samuel is later elevated to the Council. Whether Gilliam chose him despite the betrayal or because of it — keeping enemies close — is never explained.

### Physical Evidence (Discoverable in Game)
- Irena's hidden notes in the walls of Car 6 (behind a loose panel near the sink)
- The paralytic compound formula (usable by the player in certain routes)
- Surveillance equipment installed in the Kitchen after the plot (cameras, sampling stations)
- A scratched chemical formula on the underside of a Sickbay table (Irena's work notes)

## Revolution 4: The Signal Hack (Year 12)

### Context
The Kronole trade is flowing freely. With it comes information — fragments, rumors, data points from the forward sections. Among the noise, one signal: the Comms Center (Zone 4) has detected something outside the train. An external radio contact. Someone — or something — is alive out there. Wilford has suppressed the information.

### The Leader: "Sparks"
- **Background:** Tail-born teenager, approximately 16 years old. Real name unknown even to most Tailies. The first generation to grow up entirely on the train. Never saw the sky. Raised on stories of the outside world that she memorized and analyzed with an engineer's precision.
- **Philosophy:** Information warfare. You don't need to break down doors if you can change what people believe. Broadcast the truth. Let the train decide.
- **Fatal flaw:** Overestimated the truth's power. Eleven seconds of truth was not enough to overcome seventeen years of propaganda.

### The Plan
Tap into Snowpiercer's internal communications backbone from the Listening Post (Car 8). Broadcast a message to every speaker on the train simultaneously. Content: temperature data showing the outside world is warming. The freeze is ending. Wilford knows. He is choosing to maintain the train — and its class system — rather than allow people to consider alternatives.

### The Team
- Sparks (leader, signal specialist)
- Blind Yuri (Listening Post chief, provided access and training)
- Four Listening Post technicians (wiring, timing, signal relay)

### The Broadcast
**Circuit 19, Day 147. 0300 hours (train-wide night cycle).**

For eleven seconds, Sparks' voice plays through every speaker on Snowpiercer:

> *"The outside temperature at Latitude 43 was minus twelve degrees on the last pass. It was minus thirty-one the circuit before. The world is warming. Wilford knows. He is keeping you on this train."*

Eleven seconds. Then the Order of the Engine's communication officers cut the feed.

### The Response
- **First Class:** Dismissed as a prank or Kronole hallucination. The Propaganda Studio issues a statement within hours: "A malfunction in the communication system briefly broadcast distorted audio. The matter is being investigated."
- **Second Class:** Mixed. The Bureaucracy supports the official line. But in the Second Class Lounge, in the Archive, in quiet conversations, people begin asking questions.
- **Third Class:** Interest, but no action. Third Class has enough problems without speculating about the outside.
- **The Tail:** Electric. The message confirms what the Thaw believers have suspected. It provides data — actual numbers. The temperature is rising. The world is waking up.
- **Wilford:** Furious. Not because of the content (which he knows is true) but because of the breach. The communications backbone is encrypted within 48 hours. Surveillance of the Listening Post intensifies.

### The Disappearance
Sparks vanishes after the broadcast. The Jackboots claim she was captured in a sweep of Car 8. No body is produced. No trial is held. No record of her imprisonment exists in any known system.

Theories:
- **She was killed.** The simplest explanation. Jackboots caught her and disposed of her quietly.
- **She escaped into the maintenance tunnels.** The undercarriage passages, though the Tail's hatches are welded shut, can be accessed from other points. Sparks may have found one.
- **She is in the Drawers.** The suspended animation punishment system in the Sanctum (Zone 6). If Wilford wanted to keep her alive but silent, the Drawers would be the method.
- **She is on Big Alice.** The wildest theory, but not impossible. If Big Alice intercepted the broadcast and rendezvoused within the window, a transfer in the undercarriage during a bridge crossing is theoretically possible.

### Aftermath
- The Thaw movement dates its founding to Sparks' eleven-second broadcast. What was a loose collection of superstition became a faction with data.
- The Listening Post operates under heavier surveillance but continues to function. Blind Yuri was questioned and released — his blindness makes him seem harmless. This is his greatest advantage.
- The tap point Sparks used still exists, hidden behind a panel in Car 8. Recovering the original broadcast from the train's communication logs is a quest objective.

### Physical Evidence (Discoverable in Game)
- The hidden tap point in Car 8 (behind a specific panel, requires Listening Post hint to find)
- Sparks' handwritten temperature calculations, scratched into the underside of a bunk in Car 1 (her childhood home)
- A recording of the broadcast exists in the Comms Center's logs (Zone 4) — recoverable with the right access codes
- Thaw symbol: a circle with a raindrop, scratched in hidden places throughout the train. Sparks designed it. It marks safe houses, sympathetic contacts, and information caches.

## What the Revolutions Teach

Each revolt refined the Tail's understanding:

| Revolt | Lesson |
|--------|--------|
| **Creed (Y3)** | Frontal force fails against a prepared enemy. You need intelligence. |
| **Kaz (Y5)** | Alternative routes exist but require complete information. One unknown kills you. |
| **Irena (Y8)** | Asymmetric methods work — but require unity. Internal dissent is deadlier than the enemy. |
| **Sparks (Y12)** | Information is a weapon, but eleven seconds isn't enough. You need to *hold* the system, not just breach it. |

The current revolt — the player's revolt — incorporates all four lessons:
- **Intelligence** (Gilliam's source, the Listening Post, the smuggling network)
- **Alternative routes** (the Workshop's hidden hatch, the Forgotten's Dark Car)
- **Asymmetric options** (Irena's formula, Kronole weapons, social manipulation)
- **Information warfare** (Sparks' tap point, the Thaw network, evidence to turn factions)

Whether it also inherits their failures — Creed's recklessness, Kaz's incomplete planning, Irena's trust in the wrong people, Sparks' faith that truth alone is enough — depends on the player.
