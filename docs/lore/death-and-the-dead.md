# Death and the Dead

## The Problem

A sealed ecosystem with ~2,800 people generates approximately 30–40 corpses per year. On a train where every gram of organic matter is part of a closed-loop system, the dead are not merely a spiritual concern — they are a **resource management problem**.

How each zone handles death reveals everything about its values.

## Zone 1: The Tail

### The Wake
When a Tailie dies, the community gathers in Car 1 — the Dead End. This is the only Tail car with enough open space for a collective assembly.

**The ritual:**
1. **The Naming.** The deceased's name is spoken aloud by whoever knew them best. Their life is recounted — not in eulogy but in facts. What they did. Who they loved. How they contributed.
2. **The Scratching.** The name is carved into the memorial wall of Car 1 using a nail. The wall is nearly full. There is quiet discussion about what happens when it is.
3. **The Stripping.** The body is respectfully stripped of usable materials. Clothing. Metal fittings (buttons, zippers, belt buckles). Dental work (rare but valuable metal). Hair (woven into cord). This is not disrespect — it is survival. The dead would understand.
4. **The Release.** The stripped body is carried to the undercarriage access hatch in Car 11 (the Freezer Breach, where the hull is compromised) and passed into the exterior crawlspace. The wind and cold take it. Within hours, the body is frozen solid and eventually torn free by wind shear.

**The psychology:** Tailies are pragmatic about death because they have no alternative. The memorial wall and the oral naming tradition preserve dignity. The stripping preserves resources. The release to the outside is the closest thing to a burial — and the only time a Tailie's body ever touches the world beyond the train.

### The Dark Time Exception
During the Dark Time (Year 1, months 1–3), before protein blocks arrived, some Tailies consumed the dead. This is the Tail's deepest shame. It is never spoken of directly. References are oblique: "the hungry months," "before the blocks," "when we lost ourselves." Gilliam was among those who participated (his self-amputation was, in some tellings, an alternative to eating others). The Tail has collectively decided to remember the Dark Time as a wound, not a sin.

## Zone 2: Third Class

### The Processing
Third Class deaths are reported to the Shift Office (Car 21), which records the death in the census and issues a work reassignment for the deceased's role. The body is sent to the **Sanitation Systems** (Car 22) for "processing."

Processing is clinical:
1. **Cataloguing.** Personal effects are inventoried and either returned to family or recycled.
2. **Organic reclamation.** The body is rendered in an industrial composting unit. Bones are ground. Soft tissue is broken down by bacterial cultures. The resulting organic matter is fed into the Hydroponics Bay (Car 28) as fertilizer.
3. **No ceremony.** Third Class workers are permitted a 30-minute bereavement period. Work resumes.

**What Third Class knows:** Everyone knows. It's not a secret. The compost system is openly described in orientation (Car 16). The reaction ranges from grim acceptance ("at least we're useful") to quiet horror that never fully fades.

**What Third Class doesn't know:** The protein blocks sent to the Tail also contain trace amounts of composted human biological material. Not as a primary ingredient — the insect colonies provide most of the protein — but as a mineral supplement. Wilford's nutritionists calculated that the closed ecosystem could not sustain the Tail's population without recycling *all* organic waste, including human remains. This information is classified.

## Zone 3: Second Class

### The Service
Second Class maintains the most "normal" death rituals on the train. The Chapel of the Engine (Car 23, though the main chapel is in the Cathedral Car, Zone 6) conducts funeral services:

1. **The Ceremony.** An Order of the Engine priest conducts a service emphasizing the cyclical nature of the Engine — energy transformed, never destroyed.
2. **The Memory.** A page is added to the Book of Passages, maintained in the Archive (Car within Zone 3). Name, date of boarding, date of death, contribution to the train.
3. **The Return.** The body is sent to Sanitation Systems for composting, same as Third Class. The difference is that Second Class families receive a small ceramic urn containing a symbolic amount of "ashes" (actually calcium powder from the bone grinding process).

**The pretense:** Second Class maintains the fiction that death is meaningful and individual. The urns, the ceremony, the Book of Passages — these are the trappings of a civilization that still values personhood. Whether this is genuine respect or performative denial depends on the observer.

## Zone 5: First Class

### The Preservation
First Class does not compost its dead. This is the most significant material privilege of the upper class: even in death, they are not recycled.

1. **The Viewing.** The body is prepared by the Tailor (Car in Zone 5) — dressed in finest clothes, displayed in the Ballroom for a viewing period of 24 hours.
2. **The Service.** A full Order of the Engine ceremony in the Cathedral Car (Zone 6). The High Priest officiates personally.
3. **The Cryogenic Vault.** The body is moved to the Cryogenics Bay (Zone 6) and frozen in a cryogenic pod. First Class dead are preserved indefinitely, occupying valuable space and energy that could sustain the living.

**The rationale (official):** "When the world warms, the dead will be returned to the earth with full honors."

**The rationale (actual):** First Class paid for immortality. Their tickets included a clause — rarely read, deeply buried in the terms — guaranteeing "preservation of remains for the duration of the journey." Wilford honored this clause because it reinforced the class system's core promise: wealth buys everything, even dignity in death.

**The cost:** The Cryogenics Bay currently holds 47 First Class corpses. Each pod consumes approximately the same power as heating a Third Class bunk room. The energy required to preserve the dead could sustain 50 living people. This information is available in the Cold Lab's records and is dynamite in the hands of a revolutionary.

## Zone 6: The Sanctum

### The Martyrdom
Deaths in the Sanctum are rare and always significant. Wilford's inner circle — guards, priests, scientists — are either honored or erased:

**Honored dead:** Those who die in service to the Engine's mission. Their names are inscribed on the walls of the Cathedral Car. Their bodies are composted, but their "essence" is said to feed the Engine itself (this is theology, not mechanics).

**Erased dead:** Those who fail Wilford or are found disloyal. Their names are removed from all records. Their bodies are composted without ceremony. They become non-persons. The Sanctum's message is clear: serve faithfully and be remembered forever. Fail, and you never existed.

## Zone 7: The Engine

### The Unknown
No one outside the Engine crew knows what happens to the dead in Zone 7. The Engine crew — a handful of senior engineers and, secretly, the child laborers who maintain the smallest components — live and die in isolation.

The truth: deaths in the Engine are immediate problems. A dead engineer must be replaced. A dead child must be replaced. The body is fed into the Engine's auxiliary thermal system — a furnace that generates supplementary heat for the forward cars. The children know this. They have seen it. They say nothing because there is no one to tell.

## The Player's Encounter with Death

As the player progresses through the train, their understanding of death evolves:

| Zone | Discovery | Emotional Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 (Tail) | The memorial wall, the stripping, the release | Grim but dignified. This is *our* way. |
| 2 (Third) | Industrial composting, human fertilizer | Disturbing efficiency. People become dirt. |
| 3 (Second) | Fake urns, performative ceremony | The comfort of lies. Is pretending respect? |
| 5 (First) | Cryogenic preservation while the living starve | Rage. The dead consume what the living need. |
| 6 (Sanctum) | Erasure of the disloyal | Terror. Even death can be taken from you. |
| 7 (Engine) | Children watching bodies burn | Horror. The final revelation of the system's cost. |

Each zone's treatment of the dead is a mirror of its treatment of the living. The train is a machine that consumes people — some slowly, some quickly, some with ceremony, some without. The only question is whether the machine can be stopped.
