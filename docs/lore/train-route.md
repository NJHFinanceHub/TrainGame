# The Train Route

## Route Type: Circular Loop

Snowpiercer runs a continuous **circumnavigation circuit** — a single closed loop that circles the globe. There is no destination. There is no terminus. The train runs because it must: the Eternal Engine requires motion to function. If Snowpiercer stops, it dies. If it dies, everyone aboard dies.

This is not a metaphor. The Engine's perpetual-motion system generates power through the kinetic interaction between the train's mass and the track's electromagnetic rail system. Below a threshold speed of approximately 30 km/h, power generation drops below the minimum required to sustain life support, heating, and water recycling. The train cannot stop for more than 12 hours before critical systems begin failing.

Snowpiercer is not a vehicle. It is a habitat that happens to move.

## Circuit Duration

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Full circuit length** | ~71,000 km |
| **Average speed** | ~80 km/h (varies by terrain) |
| **Circuit duration** | ~238 days (roughly 7.9 months) |
| **Circuits completed (Year 17)** | 26 full circuits, currently in Circuit 27 |
| **Total distance traveled** | ~1.85 million km |

Speed varies significantly by terrain:
- **Open plains (Siberian Plateau, Australian Interior):** 100–120 km/h
- **Mountain passes (Andes, Alps, Himalayas):** 40–60 km/h
- **Oceanic bridges:** 60–80 km/h
- **Tunnel sections:** 50–70 km/h
- **Urban ruins (former cities along the route):** 70–90 km/h

The train does not stop. It slows, it accelerates, it navigates curves and gradients — but it never stops.

## The Track Network

### Construction
The track was built between 2024 and 2030 by Wilford Industries using automated boring machines and rail-laying systems. Officially, it was marketed as a luxury rail tourism project. The engineering, however, was designed for permanence:

- **Track material:** Reinforced composite rail on thermally stable concrete ties
- **Gauge:** Custom wide gauge (2.5m) for stability at high loads
- **Power integration:** Electromagnetic induction strips embedded in the rail bed for supplementary power generation
- **Climate hardening:** Track designed to withstand temperature extremes from +50°C to -80°C, seismic activity, and decades without maintenance

### Route Geography

The loop follows a path roughly tracing continental coastlines and existing rail corridors, with major engineering works to bridge oceans and cross mountain ranges:

**Leg 1: East Asia → Siberia** (~12,000 km, ~6 days)
- Departure point: Vladivostok, Russia
- Runs north through Khabarovsk, then west across the Siberian Plateau
- Coldest segment of the route. External temperatures: -70°C to -85°C
- Notable feature: The Siberian Straight — 3,000 km of flat, featureless ice plain

**Leg 2: Russia → Europe** (~8,000 km, ~4 days)
- Through the Ural Mountains (reduced speed section)
- Across the frozen plains of Eastern Europe
- Through the Alpine Tunnels — a 200 km tunnel system bored through the Alps
- Notable feature: The Frozen Cities — the track passes through the ruins of Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, Paris. Passengers in observation cars can see the frozen skylines.

**Leg 3: Europe → Africa** (~6,000 km, ~3 days)
- Crosses the Strait of Gibraltar via the Gibraltar Bridge (a Wilford Industries engineering marvel — a 14 km enclosed rail bridge)
- Down the western coast of Africa through the Sub-Saharan Tunnel Complex
- Notable feature: The Gibraltar Crossing — the only point where the train runs above open water (frozen, but the ice shifts and groans beneath the bridge)

**Leg 4: Africa → South America** (~8,000 km, ~5 days)
- Crosses the South Atlantic via the **Atlantic Bridge** — the most ambitious piece of infrastructure ever built. A 3,200 km elevated rail system running on pylons driven into the ocean floor, now encased in ice.
- Notable feature: The Atlantic Bridge is the most dangerous section of the route. Ice buildup on the pylons and track requires the train to run a snow plow configuration. The bridge sways in high winds. Every crossing, passengers hold their breath.

**Leg 5: South America** (~10,000 km, ~6 days)
- Landfall on the Brazilian coast, then south to Patagonia
- Through the Andean Tunnels — a 400 km tunnel system through the Andes at altitude
- Notable feature: The Andean tunnels are geothermally heated. Interior temperatures rise noticeably during this section. The Thaw believers consider this evidence that warmth still exists.

**Leg 6: South America → North America** (~12,000 km, ~7 days)
- Up the Pacific coast through Central America
- Across the former United States via the Great Plains corridor
- Through the Canadian Shield to the Bering Land Bridge approach
- Notable feature: The Great Plains segment passes through the ruins of former American cities. The ice here is thinner than in Siberia. Temperature readings are sometimes higher than expected.

**Leg 7: North America → East Asia** (~15,000 km, ~7 days)
- The Bering Bridge — a 90 km crossing from Alaska to Russia via the frozen Bering Strait
- Down through Kamchatka and along the Pacific coast of Russia
- Returns to Vladivostok — the starting point. The circuit completes.
- Notable feature: The Bering Crossing is the shortest ocean bridge but runs across pack ice rather than a fixed structure. The track is laid on the frozen sea floor, exposed when ice shifts. It is the oldest and most unreliable section of the route.

## Seasonal Variation

Even in a frozen world, there are variations. The Earth still tilts on its axis. The sun still rises and sets (when visible through the CW-7 haze). This creates subtle but measurable differences:

- **"Summer" (hemispheric):** External temps rise 5–10°C in the illuminated hemisphere. Still lethal, but measurably warmer.
- **"Winter" (hemispheric):** External temps drop an additional 10–15°C. The Siberian leg in winter reaches -90°C.
- **The Thaw Signal:** Over the past 3–4 circuits, temperature readings have shown a slow upward trend. The Cold Lab has confirmed a 2°C increase in average global surface temperature compared to Year 10. This is the data Sparks tried to broadcast.

## Landmarks and Events

Passengers mark time not by calendar but by landmarks — recurring geographical features that signal position on the circuit:

| Landmark | Location | Significance |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **The Yekaterina Bridge** | Ural Mountains | Steel bridge over frozen gorge. The train slows. Children are told to look. |
| **The Frozen Cities** | Europe | Moscow, Berlin, Paris visible from observation cars. A reminder of what was lost. |
| **Gibraltar Crossing** | Strait of Gibraltar | Ocean crossing. Ice groans. First Class throws a party. The Tail feels the sway. |
| **The Atlantic Bridge** | South Atlantic | Most dangerous segment. Prayers in the Cathedral Car. White-knuckle engineering. |
| **The Warm Tunnels** | Andes | Temperature rises. The only time passengers feel something other than cold. |
| **Dead Chicago** | North America | The ruins of Chicago are visible for 20 minutes at speed. A popular viewing event in First Class. |
| **The Bering Shake** | Bering Strait | The track shifts on the ice. The whole train shudders. Everyone knows this section. |
| **Vladivostok Pass** | Russia | The circuit marker. Wilford broadcasts a speech. The Order holds a service. Another year survived. |

## What Passengers Know

- **First Class and Second Class** have access to a simplified route map displayed in the Observation Deck and lounges. They know the landmarks and the circuit timing.
- **Third Class** knows the landmarks from observation windows in the Mess Hall. They measure time by work shifts, not geography.
- **The Tail** has no windows. They know the circuit by vibration and sound: the rhythmic change when crossing a bridge, the muffled rumble in the tunnels, the particular sway of the Atlantic Bridge. Blind Yuri has mapped the entire route by sound alone. His map — scratched onto a metal panel in the Listening Post — is one of the Tail's most valuable possessions.
