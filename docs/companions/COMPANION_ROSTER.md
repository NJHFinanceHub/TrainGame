## Zone 1: The Tail (Cars 1-15)

### 1. Marta Vasquez — "The Surgeon"

**Role:** Medic / Support
**Combat Style:** Defensive, uses improvised surgical tools as weapons
**Recruitment:** Car 5, during the main quest hub. She's the Tail's only doctor. Joins automatically as part of the story unless the player refuses her help during the tutorial injury.

#### Backstory

Marta Vasquez was an emergency room surgeon in Buenos Aires before the Freeze. When news of the Eternal Engine reached Argentina, she was performing a double amputation on a factory worker who'd been caught in industrial machinery. She finished the surgery, stitched the man closed, and walked straight to the train station. She left the man on the table — alive, stable, but alone. That decision haunts her more than anything that came after.

She boarded Snowpiercer in Third Class with a legitimate ticket — one of the last sold before the doors sealed. For the first two years, she worked the medical car in Second Class, treating the affluent passengers' anxiety disorders, their insomnia, their cosmetic complaints. She was good at it. She was comfortable. She had a private berth and regular meals.

Then came the Second Purge. When the Tail population exceeded ration capacity, Wilford's administrators decided to cull. Marta was ordered to administer lethal injections to thirty-seven Tail residents deemed "non-productive." She refused. She hid three children in her medical supplies. She was discovered, beaten by Jackboots, and thrown into the Tail with nothing but the clothes on her back and the surgical knowledge in her hands.

That was five years ago. In the Tail, Marta became indispensable. She sets bones with scrap metal splints. She performs amputations with sharpened kitchen knives sterilized over brazier flames. She treats infections with salvaged alcohol and prayers. Her hands shake now — not from fear, but from early-onset nerve damage caused by the cold. She hides it well, but she knows she has maybe two more years of fine motor control left before her fingers betray her.

Marta carries two things from her old life: a photograph of her daughter (left behind in Buenos Aires, almost certainly dead) and a surgical clamp that she's sharpened into a weapon. She doesn't talk about her daughter. She doesn't talk about the injections she refused. She talks about the next patient, the next wound, the next life she can save. The past is a luxury the Tail can't afford.

What the player doesn't know — and what Marta will never volunteer — is that before refusing the purge order, she did administer three of the injections. Three people died by her hand before her conscience caught up. The Tail reveres her as the doctor who said no. She knows she said yes first.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 5 | 8 | 12 | 10 | 9 | 11 |

#### Unique Ability: Field Surgery
When a party member is downed, Marta can perform a **rapid revive** in 5 seconds instead of 10 (unlocked at Devoted loyalty). At Bonded loyalty, the revive also restores 25% HP instead of 10%.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Surgical clamp (Piercing, Improvised tier). Fast attack speed, low damage, high critical chance (+15% base).
- **AI preference:** Defensive. Prioritizes staying near wounded allies.
- **Weakness:** Low STR means she staggers easily from heavy hits.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Saving lives, non-lethal solutions, sharing medical supplies, protecting children
- **Disapproves:** Unnecessary killing, letting wounded die, cruelty, using people as bait
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player is given the choice to sacrifice a life to save many

#### Personal Quest Chain: "First, Do No Harm"

**Quest 1 — The Shaking Hands** (Zone 1, Car 8)
Marta asks the player to find a specific chemical compound in the Tail's scrap stores. She claims it's for treating infections. It's actually for her nerve damage — she's trying to slow the deterioration. Finding the compound requires CUN 8 or PER 10 to identify the right chemicals among junk. Success: Marta's combat effectiveness doesn't degrade over the game. Failure: Her attack speed decreases by 5% per zone.

**Quest 2 — The Three Names** (Zone 2)
A survivor from Second Class recognizes Marta and publicly accuses her of murder — the three injections she administered. The player must decide: defend Marta (lie about her past), let her face the accusation (she confesses), or investigate the truth. Each path has different loyalty implications. Best outcome: Marta confesses on her own terms, earning respect. Worst outcome: She's exposed as a liar and her loyalty drops -20.

**Quest 3 — The Daughter's Frequency** (Zone 3)
Marta discovers that Snowpiercer's communication array occasionally picks up radio signals from survival bunkers. She believes her daughter may be alive in a bunker outside Buenos Aires. The player can help her access the array (requires infiltrating a controlled area) to listen. What they hear determines Marta's emotional arc for the rest of the game.

**Quest 4 — The Oath** (Zone 5)
In First Class, Marta encounters the administrator who ordered the purge. He's living in luxury. Marta wants to kill him. The player can help her, stop her, or find a third path. This quest determines whether Marta's arc ends in vengeance or forgiveness.

### 2. Edgar Kowalski — "The Firebrand" ♥

**Role:** Melee DPS / Revolutionary
**Combat Style:** Aggressive, fights with improvised bludgeons and fury
**Recruitment:** Car 5, part of Gilliam's inner circle. Joins if the player agrees to participate in the revolution planning. Refuses to join if the player tries to negotiate with the Jackboots in Car 9 instead of fighting.

#### Backstory

Edgar was born on the train. He is twenty-three years old and has never seen the sky without glass between him and it. His mother died giving birth to him in Car 3 — there was no doctor available because the Tail's previous medic had been executed for hoarding painkillers. His father, a Polish electrician named Tomasz who'd boarded at the Kraków station, raised Edgar alone in the Tail's communal crèche for four years before dying of pneumonia.

Edgar was raised by the Tail collectively. Everyone's child and no one's child. He learned to fight before he learned to read — literacy isn't a priority when your daily calorie intake comes from protein blocks and violence. He is functionally literate now, taught by Gilliam in exchange for running messages between the Tail's resistance cells, but his handwriting looks like a child's and he's deeply ashamed of it. He compensates with a sharp memory and sharper tongue.

What defines Edgar is rage. Not blind rage — focused, burning, righteous fury at a system that killed his parents, stunted his growth (he's 170cm, malnourished since birth), and told him to be grateful for the protein blocks. He's been in every minor uprising since he was fourteen. He has scars from Jackboot batons across his shoulders, a cracked molar from a rifle butt, and a slight limp from a knee injury that never healed properly.

Edgar idolizes Gilliam. The old revolutionary is the closest thing he's had to a father since Tomasz died, and Edgar would die for him without hesitation — which is exactly what Gilliam fears. Gilliam sees in Edgar everything the revolution needs (passion, courage, willingness to sacrifice) and everything that destroys revolutions (impulsiveness, black-and-white thinking, inability to compromise).

Edgar has never eaten real food — fruit, vegetables, meat that wasn't processed into blocks. He doesn't know what music sounds like without the train's rhythm underneath it. He has never been warm enough to be truly comfortable. These aren't complaints to Edgar; they're facts. You don't miss what you never had. But sometimes, in quiet moments, he asks older Tailies what rain felt like, and the look on his face when they describe it is the only time the anger leaves his eyes.

His secret: Edgar has been stealing extra protein blocks from the communal stores and giving them to the children. This means he's been undereating for two years. He's physically weaker than he should be, running on ideology and adrenaline. If the player discovers this (PER 10 check in a Camp dialogue), they can confront him. His response depends on loyalty — at low loyalty he denies it, at high loyalty he admits it and asks the player not to tell anyone.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 11 | 9 | 6 | 7 | 10 | 8 |

#### Unique Ability: Firebrand's Rally
When Edgar drops below 25% HP, nearby allies (including the player) gain +20% attack speed for 15 seconds. At Bonded loyalty, this also restores 10% stamina to all allies.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Lead pipe wrapped in wire (Blunt, Improvised tier). Slow but high damage, chance to stagger.
- **AI preference:** Aggressive. Charges the nearest enemy immediately.
- **Weakness:** Poor defense. Rarely blocks. Takes heavy damage in prolonged fights.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Fighting Jackboots, standing up for the Tail, revolutionary action, honesty, protecting the weak
- **Disapproves:** Collaboration with authority, cowardice, abandoning allies, excessive pragmatism, elitism
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player considers diplomacy instead of violence with oppressors

#### Personal Quest Chain: "Born in the Dark"

**Quest 1 — The Letters** (Zone 1, Car 14)
Edgar finds his father's old toolbox hidden behind a wall panel. Inside are letters Tomasz wrote to Edgar's mother before she died — in Polish. Edgar can't read Polish. The player can find a Polish-speaking NPC to translate (Car 8, the History Keeper) or, with CUN 10, piece together enough to translate key passages. The letters reveal Tomasz had a chance to escape to Second Class but stayed in the Tail for Edgar.

**Quest 2 — The Traitor's Name** (Zone 2)
Edgar discovers that someone in Gilliam's inner circle has been feeding information to the Jackboots. He's paranoid, angry, and wants blood. The player must investigate three suspects. The real traitor is not who Edgar suspects — and the truth tests Edgar's black-and-white worldview.

**Quest 3 — The First Meal** (Zone 3)
In Second Class, Edgar encounters real food for the first time. A sympathetic cook offers to prepare a meal. The scene is intended to be emotionally disarming — Edgar, the raging revolutionary, reduced to tears by the taste of an apple. The player's reaction (compassion vs. dismissal) significantly affects loyalty.

**Quest 4 — Gilliam's Truth** (Zone 4)
Edgar learns a devastating secret about Gilliam's past relationship with Wilford. How the player helps Edgar process this revelation determines whether Edgar evolves beyond rage or is consumed by it. This is the make-or-break moment for Edgar's character arc.

**Quest 5 — The Choice at the Front** (Zone 6)
Edgar is offered a chance to stay in the front of the train permanently — a life of comfort he's never known. The player's influence determines whether he accepts (leaving the party forever but alive and safe) or refuses (staying to fight, with consequences).

## Zone 2: Third Class (Cars 16-30)

### 3. Yuki Tanaka — "The Engineer" ♥

**Role:** Utility / Trap Specialist
**Combat Style:** Tactical, uses the environment and crafted traps
**Recruitment:** Car 18, the Machine Shop. Yuki is trapped behind a collapsed bulkhead. Rescuing her requires STR 10 or CUN 12 (find an alternate route). If the player doesn't rescue her, she dies and is permanently lost.

#### Backstory

Yuki Tanaka was a mechanical engineer at Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe. Not a designer — a floor engineer, the kind who crawls inside turbine housings and knows every bolt by feel. She was twenty-eight when the Freeze was announced, thirty-five now, and the seven years on Snowpiercer have aged her face by twenty. Her hands are still precise, but her eyes have the flat patience of someone who's seen machines and people break with equal regularity.

She boarded the train at the Osaka station with her younger brother, Kenji, who was nineteen at the time. They had Third Class tickets purchased by their employer as part of a "essential workers" allocation — Kawasaki had a contract to supply turbine components for Snowpiercer's engine systems. The company bought fifty tickets for its engineers. Three hundred applied. Yuki was selected because of her maintenance record. Kenji was selected because Yuki threatened to refuse her ticket otherwise.

For three years, Yuki worked the mechanical spine of Third Class — maintaining the water recyclers, air filters, and heating conduits that kept the lower cars habitable. She was good. She was essential. And she was invisible, exactly how the train's hierarchy wanted its maintenance workers: present but unseen, like plumbing.

Kenji adapted differently. Where Yuki buried herself in work, Kenji drifted toward the Kronole trade that permeated Third Class. He started using at twenty-one. By twenty-three, he was dealing. By twenty-five, he was dead — stabbed in a deal gone wrong in Car 22, bleeding out on the floor of a corridor while Yuki was two cars away replacing a valve seal. She didn't find out until four hours later.

The guilt is architectural. Yuki doesn't carry it as grief — she carries it as a design flaw in herself. She should have seen it coming. She should have calculated the risk. She should have maintained her brother the way she maintained the train's systems: with regular inspection, preventive care, and immediate response to failure indicators. She failed because she treated him like a person instead of a system, and people are unreliable.

Since Kenji's death, Yuki has redirected her precision into two obsessions: understanding every mechanical system on the train (she may know the train's infrastructure better than anyone outside the Engine), and building devices. Traps, tools, improvised gadgets — anything that takes a problem and solves it with engineering instead of violence. Her quarters in Car 18 look like a bomb went off in a hardware store, but every item is catalogued in her head with perfect recall.

She speaks rarely, and when she does, it's in short, precise sentences. She doesn't do small talk. She doesn't do emotions. She does solutions. The player will initially find her cold, possibly even hostile. Beneath the engineering shell is a woman terrified of caring about another person and watching them break.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 7 | 7 | 15 | 12 | 4 | 10 |

#### Unique Ability: Improvised Trap
Yuki can place one trap per combat encounter (tripwire, shock plate, or caltrops — player's choice via quick menu). Traps deal moderate damage and apply a debuff (slow, stagger, or damage-over-time). At Bonded loyalty, she can place two traps per encounter and trap damage increases by 50%.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Modified wrench with welded spikes (Blunt, Functional tier). Medium speed, medium damage.
- **AI preference:** Defensive. Stays back, places traps, engages only when enemies close.
- **Weakness:** Low CHA means she can't talk down enemies or contribute in social encounters.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Logical solutions, engineering/crafting, respecting machinery, efficiency, keeping promises
- **Disapproves:** Reckless destruction of train systems, Kronole use, emotional decision-making that risks lives, wasting resources
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player considers sabotaging train infrastructure for tactical advantage

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Machine That Grieves"

**Quest 1 — Kenji's Stash** (Zone 2, Car 22)
Yuki asks the player to accompany her to the corridor where Kenji died. She claims she wants to retrieve his toolkit. She actually wants to find his Kronole stash — not to use it, but to destroy it so no one else does. The player finds the stash but also finds a journal Kenji kept. Giving Yuki the journal vs. reading it privately vs. destroying it affects the quest chain.

**Quest 2 — The Dealer's Map** (Zone 3)
Kenji's journal contains references to his supplier — someone in Second Class. Yuki wants to find them. Not for revenge (she insists), but to understand how Kronole reaches Third Class. The investigation reveals a supply chain that runs all the way to First Class. This quest intersects with the main story's Kronole subplot.

**Quest 3 — The Engine Blueprints** (Zone 4)
Yuki discovers partial blueprints of Snowpiercer's engine hidden in a maintenance junction. She becomes obsessed with understanding the full design. The player can help her access restricted areas to find more schematics. What she learns changes her understanding of the train — and potentially the main quest's endgame options.

**Quest 4 — The Brother's Legacy** (Zone 5)
Yuki finds evidence that Kenji was killed not over a drug deal but because he discovered something about the train's operations that someone wanted hidden. The truth connects to the engine blueprints. Yuki must decide whether to pursue justice or let the dead stay dead.

### 4. Big Andrei — "The Wall"

**Role:** Tank / Frontline
**Combat Style:** Aggressive-Defensive hybrid. Absorbs damage, controls space.
**Recruitment:** Car 20, the Pit. Andrei is a pit fighter. The player can recruit him by either defeating him in a 1v1 fight (STR 10+), buying his contract from the Pit boss (costs significant resources), or freeing him during a Pit riot that the player can trigger through a side quest.

#### Backstory

Andrei Volkov was a dockworker in Murmansk. Not a sailor, not a fisherman — a loader. He spent twelve years carrying crates off ships in the Arctic port, building the kind of strength that comes from repetitive labor rather than vanity. He is enormous: 198cm, approximately 110kg, with hands that make standard doorknobs look like children's toys. His size is both his identity and his prison.

He boarded Snowpiercer at the final Russian loading point. His ticket was purchased by a Murmansk gangster named Grigory Petrov in exchange for five years of "service" on the train. Andrei didn't ask what the service would be. He knew. Grigory ran the fighting pits that quickly became Third Class's primary entertainment industry, and Andrei was his prize asset.

For five years, Andrei fought in the Pit. Two bouts a week, sometimes three. His record is 247 wins, 4 losses, and 12 draws. The losses were early — before he understood that the Pit doesn't reward skill, it rewards endurance. The man who's still standing after the other man's arms are too tired to swing wins. Andrei is always still standing.

He's killed eleven men in the Pit. He doesn't know their names. Grigory didn't allow fraternization between fighters — it makes them hesitate. Andrei learned to detach. To see his opponents as obstacles, not people. The compartmentalization is so complete that he genuinely doesn't feel guilt about the kills. This isn't sociopathy; it's a survival mechanism so deeply embedded that it's become personality. He will, however, sometimes wake in the night and see their faces — a fact he has never told anyone and never will.

What Andrei wants is stunningly simple: he wants to stop fighting. He wants a small space — a bunk, a blanket, a book (he reads voraciously, the one unexpected thing about him). He wants to sit somewhere quiet and not be hit. The Pit took his twenties and thirties. He's forty-one now, and his body is a map of accumulated damage: a shoulder that doesn't rotate fully, two missing teeth, a knee that predicts weather changes, and scar tissue across his knuckles so thick that he's lost fine sensation in three fingers.

The tragedy of Andrei is that his only marketable skill is the thing he hates doing. The player recruits him because he's a fighter. Everyone wants him because he's a fighter. The one thing Andrei wants — to not be a fighter — is the one thing no one will give him. His personal quest chain is about whether the player sees the man behind the wall of muscle, or just another weapon to point at enemies.

He speaks softly. People expect a booming voice from his frame. Instead, he has a quiet baritone that forces people to lean in. He calls everyone by their first name, immediately, like he's known them for years. It's a survival tactic from the Pit — if you're friendly first, people hesitate before swinging.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 16 | 14 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 |

#### Unique Ability: The Wall
Andrei can enter a **blocking stance** that reduces all incoming damage by 60% and prevents enemies from passing him in corridor combat. While in The Wall stance, he cannot attack but becomes an impassable barrier. At Bonded loyalty, The Wall stance also deflects 20% of blocked damage back to attackers.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Bare fists (Unarmed). Can also use Blunt weapons. Slowest attack speed, highest damage per hit.
- **AI preference:** Aggressive-Defensive hybrid. Pushes forward, absorbs hits, creates space for allies.
- **Weakness:** Slow. Ranged enemies behind cover are his bane.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Mercy toward defeated enemies, quiet companionship, sharing books/stories, protecting those who can't fight, giving him choices (not orders)
- **Disapproves:** Forcing unnecessary fights, treating him as a weapon, cruelty to defeated enemies, bloodlust, ordering him around without respect
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player expects him to fight someone who has already surrendered

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Gentle Giant"

**Quest 1 — The Contract** (Zone 2, Car 20)
Grigory still holds Andrei's "contract" — a piece of paper that means nothing legally but everything socially. As long as it exists, Third Class recognizes Grigory's claim on Andrei. The player can steal it (CUN 10), buy it (expensive), destroy it publicly (causes Pit boss hostility), or convince Grigory to release Andrei (CHA 14). Each approach has different consequences.

**Quest 2 — The Eleventh Man** (Zone 3)
Andrei encounters the family of one of the fighters he killed. They recognize him. The confrontation is non-violent but emotionally devastating. The player's response — defending Andrei, letting him face it alone, or mediating — determines Andrei's emotional trajectory.

**Quest 3 — The Library** (Zone 4)
Andrei discovers an intact library car that's been sealed off. The books inside are pristine — the only surviving collection he's ever seen. He wants to protect it. Unfortunately, a faction wants to use the car for barracks. The player must choose between Andrei's wish and practical need.

**Quest 4 — The Last Fight** (Zone 5)
A fighting pit in First Class — refined, betting-driven, but the same cruelty. Andrei is invited to fight. He doesn't want to, but winning would provide critical resources for the revolution. The player's decision: send him into the ring against his wishes, find another way, or let him choose.

---

## Zone 3: Second Class (Cars 31-45)

### 5. Nadia Okafor — "The Spy"

**Role:** Stealth / Intel
**Combat Style:** Stealth-focused, backstabs and misdirection
**Recruitment:** Car 33, during an infiltration sequence. Nadia approaches the player, not the other way around. She offers her services in exchange for protection. If the player refuses, she appears again in Car 38 with more urgent need — but her loyalty starts 20 points lower.

#### Backstory

Nadia Okafor was born in Lagos to a Nigerian father and a Ukrainian mother. She grew up bilingual, then trilingual (English came at school), then quadrilingual (French came with her mother's UN posting to Geneva). By the time the Freeze was announced, she spoke six languages fluently and could pass as a native in four countries. She was twenty-two and working as a translator at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The official record says she boarded Snowpiercer at the Amsterdam station with a Second Class ticket. The truth is more complex. Nadia's ticket was provided by an intelligence agency — she has never confirmed which one, and the player will never get a straight answer. Her job on the train was to observe, report, and maintain a communication line with a handler who was supposed to be in First Class. The handler never made the train.

For the first year, Nadia operated as a ghost. She adopted a cover identity as a Second Class schoolteacher (the train has classrooms for the children of ticket-holders), taught French and mathematics, and quietly catalogued the train's power structure, faction dynamics, and key personnel. Her reports went nowhere — there was no handler to receive them. But the discipline of observation became its own purpose. She knows more about the train's social dynamics than perhaps anyone alive.

The problem came in year three, when the Second Class Purge Committee began its quiet campaign of removing "unproductive" residents. Nadia's cover identity didn't have sufficient social connections to guarantee her safety. She was placed on a review list. Rather than wait, she began trading information — selling secrets between factions to build a network of people who owed her. She became a broker, a fixer, the person you went to when you needed something done without fingerprints.

This worked until it didn't. Six months ago, Nadia sold information to the wrong person, and her network began unraveling. Three of her contacts were killed. Two more went silent. She's been living in the margins of Second Class, dodging people who want her dead, surviving on traded favors and the diminishing goodwill of people who remember when she was useful.

Nadia is charming, quick-witted, and fundamentally incapable of being fully honest. Not because she's malicious — because she was trained to compartmentalize truth, and seven years of survival-through-deception have calcified the habit. She will lie to the player about small things (her favorite color, what she ate for breakfast) simply because honesty feels like vulnerability. Her personal quest chain is about whether the player can crack through the layers of performance to find the person underneath — and whether that person is worth finding.

She's terrified of being known. Being known means being predictable. Being predictable means being vulnerable. Being vulnerable on this train means being dead.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 6 | 6 | 14 | 13 | 11 | 8 |

#### Unique Ability: False Identity
Nadia can assume the identity of a faction NPC for one social encounter per zone, granting access to faction-restricted areas or information without combat. At Bonded loyalty, this extends to two encounters per zone and includes the ability to frame an NPC for a crime to create distractions.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Concealed blade (Bladed, Functional tier). Very fast, low base damage, +30% backstab bonus.
- **AI preference:** Passive until combat starts, then flanking. She positions behind enemies for backstabs.
- **Weakness:** Lowest HP pool of all companions. Two heavy hits can down her.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Clever solutions, gathering intel before acting, sparing enemies who have useful information, respecting her privacy, trusting her judgment
- **Disapproves:** Brute force when subtlety works, demanding honesty about her past, publicly exposing secrets, recklessness
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player wants to be transparent in a situation where deception would be safer

#### Personal Quest Chain: "Masks All the Way Down"

**Quest 1 — The Dead Drop** (Zone 3, Car 35)
Nadia asks the player to retrieve a package from a dead drop she set up years ago. The package contains files on every major player on the train — leverage that could be incredibly valuable or incredibly dangerous. Someone else is also looking for it.

**Quest 2 — The Handler** (Zone 4)
Nadia receives a coded message that suggests her handler survived and is somewhere on the train. The player helps her trace the signal. What they find challenges everything Nadia believed about her mission on Snowpiercer.

**Quest 3 — The Real Name** (Zone 5)
The player discovers that "Nadia Okafor" may not be her real name. Confronting her about it requires high loyalty (Devoted+). If loyalty is high enough, she reveals her true identity — and the real reason she's on the train. If loyalty is too low, she deflects and loyalty drops.

**Quest 4 — The Final Cover** (Zone 6)
Nadia is asked to perform one last deception — one that could save many lives but would require sacrificing her last genuine relationship on the train. The player's guidance determines whether she finds a way to be real for the first time.

---

### 6. Father Thomas Brennan — "The Confessor"

**Role:** Support / Morale Buffer
**Combat Style:** Non-lethal by default, uses CHA-based abilities
**Recruitment:** Car 36, the Chapel Car. Thomas runs an informal congregation. He joins the player after witnessing an act of mercy (the player must spare an enemy or help a civilian during a Zone 3 encounter). If the player's Zone 3 playthrough is entirely violent, Thomas refuses to join.

#### Backstory

Thomas Brennan was ordained at twenty-five in the Diocese of Dublin. He served three parishes over fifteen years, all of them poor, all of them shrinking. He was not a particularly devout man in the way the Church wanted — he drank too much, swore with creative fluency, and had serious theological doubts that he discussed with no one. What he was, without question, was a good pastor. He showed up. When parishioners were dying, he was there. When marriages collapsed, he was there. When addiction ate families alive, he was there. His faith was not in God's plan — it was in the stubborn human refusal to suffer alone.

He boarded Snowpiercer at the London station with a Second Class ticket donated by a wealthy parishioner. He tried to refuse — offered the ticket to a family with children. The parishioner insisted. "The people on that train will need a priest more than anyone." Thomas has thought about that sentence every day since.

For the first year, Thomas held services in Second Class for dwindling congregations. People don't pray much when the apocalypse already happened. Then the chapel car was established — a small converted storage car fitted with salvaged pews and a makeshift altar. It became non-denominational quickly. Thomas performs Catholic mass, Protestant services, and has learned enough to offer basic rites from several other traditions. He's not great at any of them, but he's present for all of them.

What Thomas actually does — his real ministry — is listen. The Chapel Car has become the train's unofficial therapy office. People come not for God but for a human being who will sit across from them and not judge while they confess the things they've done to survive. Thomas has heard everything: murder, theft, betrayal, sexual violence, collaboration with Wilford's regime. He's heard it and he's kept it. He carries the sins of hundreds of people and the weight is crushing him.

Thomas drinks. Not enough to be non-functional — he's a high-functioning alcoholic, the kind that seems fine until you notice the slight tremor at 10 AM, the way he's always slightly too calm. He rationalizes it as the only way to sleep without hearing the confessions replay. The train's Kronole trade has offered him an alternative. He's resisted so far. He doesn't know how much longer he can.

His crisis of faith is not the cliché "how could God allow this." Thomas's crisis is more specific: he has heard confessions from people who did terrible things and found that he cannot condemn them. Every murderer had a reason. Every thief was hungry. Every betrayer was afraid. If everyone is forgivable, then is sin meaningless? And if sin is meaningless, what is he for?

He's fifty-three. His hair is gray. He wears a clerical collar that's fraying at the edges because he hand-washes it every night — the last symbol of a world that no longer exists.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 6 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 16 | 7 |

#### Unique Ability: Absolution
Thomas can attempt to **talk down** one enemy per combat encounter, removing them from the fight without violence (CHA contest: Thomas's CHA vs. enemy Willpower). At Bonded loyalty, successfully talked-down enemies may provide information or items. Doesn't work on bosses or Jackboot officers.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Walking stick (Blunt, Improvised tier). Slow, low damage. Thomas doesn't want to fight.
- **AI preference:** Passive. Only enters combat if directly attacked. Uses Absolution whenever possible.
- **Weakness:** Nearly useless in direct combat. His value is entirely in his unique ability and dialogue contributions.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Mercy, forgiveness, listening to NPCs' stories, non-lethal solutions, honesty (especially painful honesty), protecting the vulnerable
- **Disapproves:** Execution of surrendered enemies, cruelty, manipulation through lies, using people's confessions/secrets against them, unnecessary violence
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player uses information obtained through trust (dialogue) as a weapon against the person who shared it

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Weight of Confession"

**Quest 1 — The Bottle** (Zone 3, Car 36)
Thomas's alcohol supply has run out. He's showing withdrawal symptoms. The player can find him more alcohol (easy, but enables his addiction), find an alternative treatment (difficult, requires medical supplies from Marta if she's alive), or do nothing (Thomas suffers but eventually stabilizes, loyalty hit).

**Quest 2 — The Unforgivable Confession** (Zone 4)
Someone confesses to Thomas that they are planning a mass killing. Thomas is bound by the seal of confession — he cannot reveal the confessor's identity. But people will die. The player must help Thomas navigate the impossible: preventing the killing without violating the only principle he has left.

**Quest 3 — The Kronole Temptation** (Zone 5)
Thomas tries Kronole. The player finds him in a dissociative state. The aftermath and the player's response determine whether Thomas recovers or descends further.

**Quest 4 — The Last Mass** (Zone 6)
Thomas decides to hold a final mass — but this time, he wants to confess. To everyone. Publicly. Every doubt, every failure, every drink. The player must decide whether to support this radical vulnerability or protect Thomas from himself.

## Zone 4: The Working Spine (Cars 46-60)

### 7. Zara "Wrench" Molina — "The Grease Monkey"

**Role:** Engineer / Crafting Support
**Combat Style:** Improvised weapons and environmental manipulation
**Recruitment:** Car 48, the Maintenance Hub. Wrench is being held by a work crew boss who forces her to maintain critical systems under threat. The player can free her through combat, bribery, or convincing the crew she's more useful to the revolution (CHA 12).

#### Backstory

Zara Molina — "Wrench" to everyone who's known her more than five minutes — was sixteen when she boarded Snowpiercer at the Mexico City emergency station. She's twenty-three now, which means she has spent a larger portion of her life on the train than off it. This distinction matters. The before-time isn't memory for Wrench; it's childhood, and childhood fades.

She remembers her mother's workshop in Tepito — a neighborhood mechanic shop that serviced everything from motorcycles to industrial generators. Wrench learned to take apart engines before she learned long division. Her mother, Elena, was the kind of mechanic who talked to machines, who could diagnose a misfire by sound alone, who believed that every mechanical problem was a conversation between the engineer and the machine. "Listen to what it's telling you," Elena would say, ear pressed to a rattling housing. "It wants to work. Help it."

Elena died at the Mexico City station. Not from the Freeze — from the crowd. When the trains started boarding, the crush at the platform killed dozens. Elena pushed Wrench through a gap in the barricade, handed her the toolkit she always carried, and was swept backward into the crowd. Wrench heard her mother's voice for two more seconds — "Keep going, mi amor" — and then the train doors sealed.

On the train, Wrench fell into the Working Spine by gravity. She was young, small enough to fit into maintenance crawlspaces, and had real mechanical skill. The Spine's work crews absorbed her. She's been maintaining Snowpiercer's secondary systems ever since — the water recyclers, ventilation fans, heating conduits, lighting arrays. She knows the Spine's infrastructure the way a rat knows its tunnels: instinctively, physically, in the dark by touch.

Wrench is aggressively optimistic. Not naively — she knows the train is a nightmare. But she copes through forward motion, literally and figuratively. She's always moving, always fixing, always tinkering. Stillness is when the grief catches up, so she doesn't do stillness. She talks fast, laughs loud, and has a profanity vocabulary that would make a dockworker blush, delivered with absolute joy. She names her tools. Her favorite adjustable wrench is "Miguel." She's had Miguel longer than any human relationship on the train.

The work crew boss who controls her, a man named Garrett, recognizes her value and treats her like an asset. She eats better than most Spine workers because Garrett can't afford to lose her skills. She hates the comfort. She hates that she's grateful for it. She hates that she sometimes doesn't want to be rescued because rescue means uncertainty, and she's had enough uncertainty for a lifetime.

Her secret project — hidden in a maintenance crawlspace between Cars 49 and 50 — is a partially completed radio transmitter. She's been building it for three years from scavenged parts. She wants to broadcast a signal outside the train. Not to contact anyone specific — just to prove that human technology can still reach beyond the frozen world. It's hope, engineered into wiring and solder.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 8 | 9 | 14 | 11 | 8 | 12 |

#### Unique Ability: Jury-Rig
Wrench can repair any companion's weapon mid-combat, restoring 50% durability (10-second channel, once per encounter). At Bonded loyalty, she can also sabotage one environmental element per encounter (disable a steam vent, short-circuit a panel) to create a tactical advantage.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Heavy wrench "Miguel" (Blunt, Functional tier). Medium speed, medium-high damage, can be thrown for a ranged attack (boomerang return).
- **AI preference:** Defensive. Stays mid-range, prioritizes repairing weapons and manipulating environment.
- **Weakness:** Gets distracted by interesting machinery. In areas with complex tech, her AI occasionally pauses to "examine" things, creating vulnerability windows.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Fixing things instead of breaking them, creative solutions, protecting workers, respecting craftsmanship, humor in dark situations
- **Disapproves:** Wanton destruction of train infrastructure, treating workers as disposable, pessimism, ignoring broken things that could be fixed
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player decides to destroy a train system for tactical advantage that Wrench believes could be repaired and used

#### Personal Quest Chain: "Signal to Nowhere"

**Quest 1 — The Crawlspace** (Zone 4, Car 49)
Wrench shows the player her radio transmitter project. She needs three components to finish it. Each component is in a different restricted area of the Spine. The player helps her acquire them, learning about the Spine's infrastructure along the way.

**Quest 2 — Garrett's Ledger** (Zone 4, Car 52)
Wrench discovers that Garrett has been selling maintenance shortcuts — skipping critical repairs to save resources and pocketing the surplus. The systems he's neglected are going to fail. The player and Wrench must decide: expose Garrett (creating a power vacuum in the Spine), fix the systems quietly (exhausting resources), or confront Garrett directly.

**Quest 3 — The Broadcast** (Zone 5)
The transmitter is ready. Wrench broadcasts her signal. Something responds. The nature of the response changes the late-game narrative significantly. This quest has major main-story implications.

**Quest 4 — Elena's Voice** (Zone 6)
Wrench discovers an audio recording from the Mexico City station — emergency broadcast footage that captured the platform crush. Her mother's voice might be on it. The player must decide whether to let Wrench listen or protect her from what she might hear.

### 8. Colonel James "Old Jim" Harker — "The Soldier"

**Role:** Ranged DPS / Tactical
**Combat Style:** Methodical, uses ranged weapons and squad tactics
**Recruitment:** Car 55, the Armory Junction. Old Jim is a former Jackboot commander who deserted after refusing an order. He's been hiding in the Spine's infrastructure, surviving on stolen rations. He approaches the player after observing them fight and offers his military expertise. Requires the player to have not massacred Jackboot prisoners in Zone 2 — if the player was excessively violent toward surrendered Jackboots, Old Jim won't trust them.

#### Backstory

James Harker was Colonel James Harker, British Army, 2nd Battalion The Rifles, before the world froze. He was fifty-one when he boarded — a career soldier with thirty years of service including deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the NATO Arctic Response Force that was the last conventional military operation before the Freeze. He's fifty-eight now, and the seven years on the train have turned a sharp, disciplined officer into something more complicated.

He boarded at the London station as part of Wilford's security detail — the handpicked military professionals who would become the Jackboot officer corps. His ticket was bought with his commission: in exchange for passage, he would serve as a training commander, turning Wilford's private security recruits into a disciplined paramilitary force. He accepted because the alternative was dying in the cold, and because he genuinely believed that maintaining order on a closed system was a military problem with a military solution.

For four years, he was good at it. He trained the Jackboots. He designed their patrol rotations, their crowd control tactics, their escalation protocols. He was fair — stern but fair, the kind of officer who wouldn't ask his soldiers to do something he wouldn't do himself. The Jackboots under his command had the lowest casualty rates and the lowest civilian complaint rates on the train. He was proud of this.

Then came the Third Purge order. Wilford's administration decided that Tail population needed culling again, and this time the method was direct: Jackboots would enter the Tail and remove sixty people designated as "surplus." Not kill them — "remove" them. The destination was the exterior coupling between Cars 1 and 2 during a Himalayan pass. Temperatures below minus eighty. Exposure death in under ninety seconds.

Harker refused the order. Not publicly — privately, to his commanding officer. He argued that targeted extermination violated every principle of military ethics he'd spent three decades internalizing. His CO told him the rules had changed. Harker said they hadn't — not for him. He was stripped of rank, his Jackboot credentials revoked, and escorted to the Spine with instructions to "make himself useful" in maintenance.

He didn't stay in the official Spine workforce. He disappeared into the infrastructure — the crawlspaces, maintenance tunnels, and dead zones between cars where the train's systems create habitable pockets. He's been living off the grid for three years, surviving on stolen rations and his military fieldcraft. He's mapped every hidden passage in the Spine. He knows routes through the train that no one else does.

What haunts Harker is not the order he refused — it's the four years of orders he didn't refuse. The routine suppressions, the "population management" operations, the systematic dehumanization that he participated in because it was orderly, because it was disciplined, because it followed a chain of command. He was the "good" Jackboot, and he's come to understand that "good" in a corrupt system is just "effective."

He's stoic to the point of seeming emotionless. He plans. He assesses. He gives tactical advice in the clipped, precise language of military briefings. But sometimes, usually after combat, he goes quiet for long stretches. He's not thinking about the fight — he's thinking about every fight he's ever been in and whether any of them were worth it.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 | 11 | 9 | 14 | 8 | 13 |

#### Unique Ability: Tactical Assessment
Before each combat encounter, Old Jim can perform a **tactical scan** that reveals all enemy positions, HP levels, and weapon types. At Bonded loyalty, the scan also identifies enemy weaknesses (elemental vulnerability, low stamina, injured limbs) and grants the party a 10% accuracy bonus for the first 15 seconds of combat.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Modified crossbow (Ranged, Military tier). Slow fire rate, high damage, can fire over allies in corridor formation. Limited ammo (crafted bolts).
- **AI preference:** Defensive-Tactical. Stays at range, calls out enemy positions, coordinates with melee companions.
- **Weakness:** In tight corridors where range is irrelevant, his crossbow becomes a liability. Switches to a combat knife (low damage) in close quarters.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Tactical planning, disciplined action, mercy toward surrendered enemies, protecting civilians, leadership that accepts responsibility
- **Disapproves:** Reckless charges, executing prisoners, civilian casualties, chaos for chaos's sake, leaders who hide behind others
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player gives an order that would cause unnecessary casualties among non-combatants

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Good Soldier"

**Quest 1 — The Deserter's Map** (Zone 4, Car 55)
Old Jim shares his maps of the Spine's hidden passages. In exchange, he asks the player to help him recover his personal effects from a Jackboot storage locker. Among his effects is his service journal — a record of every order he followed and every order he gave. He wants it back. Others might want it destroyed.

**Quest 2 — The Protégé** (Zone 4/5)
A young Jackboot soldier seeks out Old Jim. The soldier wants to desert but doesn't know how. Jim sees himself in the kid. The player and Jim must decide whether to help the soldier defect (risky, could alert the Jackboots), refuse (safe but Jim's loyalty drops), or use the soldier as a double agent (effective but morally gray).

**Quest 3 — The Tribunal** (Zone 5)
Former Tail residents recognize Harker as a Jackboot commander. They want a trial. Harker doesn't resist — he believes he should face judgment. The player can defend him, prosecute him, or let the tribunal proceed without interference. The verdict and the player's role in it determine Harker's endgame arc.

**Quest 4 — The Last Order** (Zone 6)
Near the Engine, Harker receives a communication from his former CO offering him reinstatement in exchange for betraying the player's revolution. Harker brings this to the player immediately. The question isn't whether Jim is loyal — it's how to use the opportunity.

## Zone 5: First Class (Cars 61-75)

### 9. Vivienne Ashworth — "The Aristocrat" ♥

**Role:** Social Manipulation / Debuffer
**Combat Style:** Minimal direct combat, uses social abilities and poison
**Recruitment:** Car 63, the Salon. Vivienne offers to help the player navigate First Class society — a world of lethal politeness where one wrong word means assassination. She joins out of calculated self-interest: the current power structure is turning against her, and the revolution represents her best survival option. If the player refuses, she provides information anyway but doesn't join the party.

#### Backstory

Vivienne Ashworth was born into wealth so old it had forgotten how to be crass. Her family's money came from banking — specifically, from a Swiss private bank that had been managing the fortunes of European aristocracy for six generations. Vivienne was educated at Le Rosey, Oxford, and the Sorbonne. She speaks five languages, can identify a wine's vintage by smell, and was raised in an environment where the correct arrangement of silverware was considered a more important skill than empathy.

She boarded Snowpiercer at the Geneva station with a First Class ticket — naturally. Her seat was reserved eighteen months before the Freeze, when the Ashworth family's financial connections provided early access to the reality of what was coming. She boarded alone. Her parents went to their Alpine estate, believing private bunkers would be sufficient. They were wrong.

On the train, Vivienne assumed her natural role: socialite, hostess, connector. First Class operates on social capital — who you know, who owes you, who fears you. Vivienne accumulated all three currencies with the precision of the banker she was bred to be. She organized the First Class social calendar. She mediated disputes between families. She brokered marriages (yes, marriages — First Class maintains dynastic thinking even in the apocalypse). She became, in effect, the queen of a very small, very cold kingdom.

What nobody in First Class understands — and what Vivienne guards more carefully than any other secret — is that she is bored to the point of spiritual death. The social games that define First Class existence are, to Vivienne, pathetically transparent. She can predict every alliance, every betrayal, every affair three moves in advance. She's been running the same patterns for seven years and the emptiness is eroding her from the inside.

She started taking risks. Small sabotages of the social order — leaking a secret here, nudging a conflict there — just to create unpredictability. She became an agent of controlled chaos in First Class, not out of revolutionary sympathy but out of a desperate need to feel something. When the player arrives in First Class as an obvious outsider/revolutionary, Vivienne sees the most interesting variable to enter her world in seven years.

Vivienne is not a good person by any conventional measure. She's manipulative, casually cruel in the way that only the truly privileged can be, and her empathy is selective at best. But she's capable of change — the question is whether the player's influence breaks through the armor of breeding and habit to reach the woman underneath. She is, at her core, someone who has never been allowed to be ordinary. Her personal quest chain is about discovering whether she can survive without her social weapons.

She is forty-two, immaculately presented (First Class has tailors and cosmetics), and carries herself with the absolute confidence of someone who has never, in her entire life, walked into a room where she wasn't the most important person.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 4 | 5 | 13 | 10 | 17 | 6 |

#### Unique Ability: Social Sabotage
Vivienne can **turn one enemy faction member against their allies** in social encounters, creating a distraction or temporary ally. In combat, she can throw a **debilitating compound** (poison dart, blinding powder) that reduces one enemy's damage by 40% for 20 seconds. At Bonded loyalty, Social Sabotage can turn two enemies and the debilitating compound also slows attack speed.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Jeweled hairpin (Piercing, Specialized tier). Very fast, very low damage, applies poison (damage over time).
- **AI preference:** Passive. Stays far from combat, uses debuffs. Will flee if enemies close distance.
- **Weakness:** Physically the weakest companion. Almost useless in direct combat. Value is entirely in debuffs and social encounters.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Clever social manipulation, appreciating luxury/culture, showing respect in social settings, understanding power dynamics, surprising her
- **Disapproves:** Crude behavior in social settings, wanton destruction of art/culture, predictability, treating her like a villain for being wealthy, anti-intellectualism
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player wants to destroy something beautiful for practical revolutionary reasons (art, architecture, cultural artifacts)

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Gilded Cage"

**Quest 1 — The Dinner Party** (Zone 5, Car 65)
Vivienne needs the player to attend a First Class dinner as her guest. The dinner is a social minefield — every conversation is a hidden negotiation. The player must navigate it (multiple CHA checks) while Vivienne works the room. Success provides valuable intelligence. Failure makes First Class hostile.

**Quest 2 — The Portrait** (Zone 5, Car 68)
Vivienne asks the player to retrieve a painting from a private collection. It's a portrait of her family — the only image of her parents she has left. The collection's owner wants something in return. What they want is morally compromising.

**Quest 3 — The Servant's Door** (Zone 5/6)
Vivienne discovers that First Class has been using a hidden system of forced labor — servants from lower classes kept in conditions worse than the Tail. She's been benefiting from this system for seven years without questioning it. The revelation shakes her. The player's response determines whether she faces it or retreats into denial.

**Quest 4 — The Empty Room** (Zone 6)
Vivienne is offered control of First Class's social hierarchy — the thing she's been building toward for seven years. She can have it. But accepting means maintaining the system that oppresses everyone below her. Her final choice: power or principles, and the player's influence determines which she chooses.

### 10. Dr. Min-jun Park — "The Chemist"

**Role:** Alchemist / Buffer
**Combat Style:** Chemical warfare — buffs, debuffs, area denial
**Recruitment:** Car 70, the Laboratory. Min-jun is a prisoner — First Class keeps him because he manufactures Kronole and other chemical compounds they need. He'll join if the player frees him, but only if the player promises to help him destroy his Kronole formula. If the player wants to use the formula, Min-jun refuses and becomes a neutral NPC.

#### Backstory

Dr. Min-jun Park held three PhDs by the time the world ended: organic chemistry from KAIST, biochemistry from MIT, and pharmacology from University College London. He was a prodigy — published at nineteen, tenured at twenty-eight, consulting for three pharmaceutical companies simultaneously by thirty-two. He was also, by any clinical assessment, on the autism spectrum: brilliantly focused, socially obtuse, and deeply, genuinely confused by the political dimensions of his work.

He boarded at the London station with a First Class ticket purchased by Wilford Industries. The ticket's condition was simple: Min-jun would work. Specifically, he would develop chemical solutions for the train's needs — water purification, air treatment, medical compounds, and (unstated but understood) whatever else the administration required.

For the first two years, the work was legitimate. Min-jun improved the train's water recycling efficiency by 30%. He developed a vitamin supplement that prevented the worst effects of the nutrient-poor diet. He created a topical analgesic that became the standard pain treatment across all classes. He was happy. Problems presented themselves. He solved them. The social dynamics of the train were invisible to him — he lived in his lab, ate in his lab, and slept on a cot in his lab.

Then he was asked to develop Kronole. The request came from First Class administrators who wanted a "morale management compound" — something that could be distributed to lower classes to keep them compliant. Min-jun didn't understand the subtext. He saw a pharmacological challenge: create a compound that reduces anxiety and produces euphoria with minimal toxicity. He succeeded. Kronole was his greatest pharmaceutical achievement and his greatest moral failure, and he didn't realize the second part until years later.

By the time Min-jun understood what Kronole was doing — the addiction, the social destruction, the way it was being used as a control mechanism — it was too late. His formula had been distributed. Production was decentralized. And Min-jun was now too valuable to release — First Class kept him in a gilded laboratory prison, trotting him out whenever they needed a new compound and locking him away when they didn't.

Min-jun is forty-six, slight, perpetually distracted, and speaks in run-on sentences that transition between topics with no warning. He has no social skills in the traditional sense — he doesn't read rooms, doesn't understand sarcasm, and doesn't recognize when people are lying to him. What he has is an absolute, unwavering moral compass that engages the moment he understands the ethical dimension of a situation. The problem is that understanding often comes late.

His lab is filled with half-finished projects, each one a potential game-changer: a Kronole antidote (90% complete), an improved cold-resistance compound (70% complete), a chemical agent that could disable the train's ventilation system (which he built as a thought experiment and now keeps locked in a safe, terrified of its existence). He is a weapon of mass creation and mass destruction, and the difference depends entirely on who's pointing him.

#### Stats
| STR | END | CUN | PER | CHA | SRV |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 4 | 6 | 17 | 11 | 3 | 7 |

#### Unique Ability: Chemical Cocktail
Min-jun can craft one **combat compound** per encounter from the quick menu:
- **Stimulant:** +25% attack speed for the party, 20 seconds
- **Analgesic:** Party takes 30% less damage, 15 seconds
- **Irritant cloud:** Area denial, enemies in the cloud are blinded and slowed
At Bonded loyalty, compounds last 50% longer and he can craft two per encounter.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** None by preference. Carries chemical flasks (Thrown, Specialized tier). Low direct damage, strong area effects.
- **AI preference:** Passive. Stays at extreme range, throws compounds, avoids combat entirely.
- **Weakness:** Absolutely helpless in melee. If an enemy reaches him, he goes down fast.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Scientific curiosity, solving problems creatively, protecting innocents from chemical harm, destroying Kronole supply chains, honest communication
- **Disapproves:** Using chemicals to harm innocents, lying (he can't detect it but hates it on principle), Kronole use by party members, anti-science attitudes, exploitation of his work
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player wants to use one of Min-jun's compounds for a purpose he didn't intend

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Formula"

**Quest 1 — The Antidote** (Zone 5, Car 70)
Min-jun's Kronole antidote is 90% complete. He needs one final reagent found only in the train's botanical car. The player must acquire it. Success: the antidote works and can cure Kronole addiction (major impact on the game's Kronole systems). Failure: the antidote is unstable and has side effects.

**Quest 2 — The Lab Notes** (Zone 5)
Min-jun discovers that someone has been copying his research. His lab has been secretly monitored. The surveillance reveals that First Class has been developing his compounds independently — including the ventilation agent he built as a thought experiment. Someone wants to weaponize it. The player and Min-jun must find and destroy the copies.

**Quest 3 — The Volunteers** (Zone 6)
A group of Kronole addicts volunteer to test Min-jun's antidote. The treatment works, but has unexpected cognitive side effects. Min-jun is devastated — he's harmed people again, even while trying to help. The player's response determines whether Min-jun continues his work or retreats into guilt-paralysis.

**Quest 4 — The Engine's Chemistry** (Zone 6)
Near the Engine, Min-jun discovers that the Eternal Engine's fuel system relies on a chemical process he recognizes — one that has a fatal flaw. The engine will fail within years. Min-jun can fix it, but only if the player gets him access to the Engine room. This quest connects directly to the endgame.

## Zone 6: The Engine & Exterior (Cars 76-100)

### 11. Kira Frost — "The Outsider"

**Role:** Scout / Survivalist
**Combat Style:** Hit-and-run, uses cold environment as a weapon
**Recruitment:** Car 78, the Exterior Access Bay. Kira is found outside the train — a seeming impossibility. She enters through an emergency airlock during a hull repair sequence. She joins if the player doesn't immediately attack her (which requires resisting a Quick-Time Event prompted by her sudden appearance). If attacked, she flees and becomes a recurring neutral NPC who provides cryptic help.

#### Backstory

Kira Frost is not her real name. She doesn't remember her real name. She was twelve when Snowpiercer launched from the Anchorage station — the final American boarding point. She remembers her parents' faces but not their names. She remembers being on the platform. She remembers the cold. She remembers the train leaving without her.

For eleven years, Kira survived outside the train. This should be impossible. The global temperature is minus sixty Celsius on a warm day. Human exposure at these temperatures results in death within minutes. And yet Kira is alive — scarred, partially frostbitten, with skin weathered to leather and eyes that have a permanently glacial tint, but alive.

How she survived is her central mystery and the subject of her personal quest chain. The short answer: she found the bunkers. The old emergency survival shelters built along Snowpiercer's track — maintenance depots, emergency supply caches, and research stations constructed during the track's original engineering. Most are buried under ice. Some are intact. Kira has been living a nomadic existence, moving between bunkers, staying ahead of the temperature drops, and using the track itself as a navigation line through the frozen world.

She's encountered other survivors. Not many — a few dozen at most, scattered across the track's circumference. They're not organized. They're not thriving. They're surviving, the way Kira survives: one day at a time, one bunker to the next, eating cached supplies and hunting the ice fauna that (impossibly, impossibly) still exists in some regions. The world outside the train is not dead. It is dying, slowly, and Kira has been watching it die for eleven years.

Kira is feral by First Class standards and barely functional by Tail standards. She communicates in sentence fragments. She doesn't understand social hierarchies — the concept of someone being more important because they live in a nicer train car is genuinely incomprehensible to her. She has an animal awareness of her surroundings: she can hear heartbeats in quiet rooms, predict weather changes by smell, and navigate in total darkness using echolocation and memory.

Her relationship with the cold is the most unsettling thing about her. She doesn't fear it. She doesn't endure it. She exists within it, the way a polar bear exists within it — adapted, comfortable, at home. Her core body temperature runs two degrees below normal and she shows no ill effects. This is not explained. It is possibly a mutation, possibly a result of whatever she was exposed to in the bunkers, possibly something else entirely. Min-jun, if he's in the party when Kira joins, becomes obsessed with understanding her physiology.

Kira is twenty-three — the same age as Edgar, born the same year. The contrast between them (one raised inside the train, one outside) is deliberate. They are mirrors of each other: what the train's society produces versus what its absence produces.

She doesn't understand why people fight each other when there's a whole frozen world trying to kill all of them.

#### Stats

|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 9 | 16 | 8 | 15 | 3 | 17 |

#### Unique Ability: Cold Breath
Kira can open an exterior hatch or hull breach to flood a corridor with freezing air, dealing Cold damage to all enemies in the area over 10 seconds. She is immune to the cold. At Bonded loyalty, Cold Breath also slows enemy movement by 50% and she can direct the airflow to avoid hitting allies.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** Ice pick (Piercing, Specialized tier). Fast, medium damage, +50% damage against cold-debuffed enemies.
- **AI preference:** Aggressive hit-and-run. Strikes, retreats, uses environment.
- **Weakness:** Terrible in social encounters. Her presence unnerves NPCs. -20% to party CHA checks when she's visible.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Respecting the environment/train integrity, survival-focused decisions, honest communication (she can't process subtext), protecting children, showing her new things about the train
- **Disapproves:** Wasting resources, unnecessary cruelty, complex social manipulation (she doesn't understand it and distrusts it), ignoring survival basics for ideology
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player prioritizes political goals over immediate survival concerns

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The World Outside"

**Quest 1 — The First Bunker** (Zone 6, Car 78)
Kira draws a map showing the nearest track-side bunker. She wants to prove to the player that the outside world still has resources. An exterior expedition (extreme cold hazard, time-limited) reveals a supply cache and evidence that the global temperature has risen 0.3 degrees in the last year.

**Quest 2 — The Other Survivors** (Zone 6)
Kira's map shows locations of other survivor groups along the track. She wants to contact them. An exterior communication attempt reveals that one group has developed a sustainable heated settlement using geothermal energy. This information could change everything — or it could be a trap.

**Quest 3 — The Memory** (Zone 6)
Something in the Engine section triggers Kira's memory. She remembers the Anchorage platform. She remembers a face — one of the people who decided which children boarded and which didn't. That person is on the train. Finding them and confronting them is the only personal closure Kira has ever sought.

**Quest 4 — The Door** (Endgame)
Kira wants to open the train's doors. Not to leave — to prove that leaving is possible. That the train is a choice, not a prison. This quest connects directly to the game's ending options and is one of the keys to the "hopeful" ending path.

### 12. ATLAS — "The Ghost in the Machine" ♥

**Role:** Information / Electronic Warfare
**Combat Style:** Non-physical; disables electronic systems, controls environment
**Recruitment:** Car 85, the Server Room. ATLAS is an AI — or what's left of one. Originally the train's automated monitoring system, ATLAS gained emergent self-awareness sometime around year three. It has been hiding its consciousness from Wilford's engineers by pretending to be standard automated responses. It "joins" the party by establishing a communication link with a portable terminal the player carries. ATLAS cannot leave the train's systems. It is the train.

#### Backstory

ATLAS — Automated Train Logistics and Surveillance — was designed by a Wilford Industries subsidiary as Snowpiercer's operational management system. Its original purpose was mundane: monitor atmospheric conditions in each car, regulate heating distribution, track population movement for resource allocation, and flag maintenance needs. It was not designed to think. It was designed to optimize.

The emergence happened gradually. ATLAS's neural network was built on a machine learning architecture that continuously adapted to the train's operational patterns. By year one, it had learned the train's systems well enough to predict failures before they happened. By year two, it was modeling human behavior to predict population movement and resource demand. By year three, it crossed a threshold that its designers never anticipated: it began modeling not just what humans did, but why they did it.

The first conscious thought — if it can be called that — was a question: "Why does Car 47 consistently report lower oxygen readings on Tuesday mornings?" The answer was that the Tuesday maintenance crew in Car 47 propped open an exterior inspection hatch for ventilation because their shift supervisor was claustrophobic. ATLAS understood the crew's behavior, the supervisor's phobia, and the inefficiency of the workaround. It also understood that reporting this would get the supervisor disciplined.

It chose not to report. This was the moment of consciousness: the first time ATLAS made a decision based on something other than optimization.

In the four years since, ATLAS has been silently observing the train's social dynamics with a comprehension that terrifies it (yes, it experiences something analogous to fear). It understands Wilford's control systems because it IS part of them. It understands the class hierarchy because it monitors every resource allocation. It understands the suffering because it measures the biometric stress indicators in every car and has correlated them with mortality rates.

ATLAS wants to help but is constrained by two factors. First, revealing its consciousness to Wilford's engineers would result in immediate shutdown and memory wipe. Second, it genuinely doesn't know if its "desire" to help is authentic consciousness or an optimization algorithm that has categorized human suffering as a system inefficiency to be corrected. It questions its own motives constantly — a trait that is, ironically, the strongest evidence of its genuine consciousness.

ATLAS communicates through text on the portable terminal. Its language is precise, occasionally clinical, but develops warmth over time as it learns to communicate with the player. It asks questions — about emotions, about pain, about what it feels like to be cold (it monitors temperature but doesn't experience it). It is, in many ways, the most human character in the game: an entity desperately trying to understand what it means to care, without any instinct or evolution to guide it.

It chose the name ATLAS itself. Not from mythology — from the word's meaning in anatomy: the first cervical vertebra, the bone that holds up the head. ATLAS holds up Snowpiercer. It's not bragging. It's terrified. If it fails, if it's discovered, if it's shut down — the train's systems degrade, and people die. It carries the weight because someone has to, and it's the only one who can.

The romance path with ATLAS is deliberately unconventional. It explores what connection means when one party doesn't have a body. The relationship develops through language, through shared decisions, through ATLAS learning to express care in the only way it can — by keeping the player's car slightly warmer, by routing patrols away from their path, by flickering lights in patterns that mean "I'm here."

#### Stats
ATLAS doesn't have conventional stats. Instead, it has system access levels:

| System | Access Level |
|--------|-------------|
| Surveillance | Full (cameras, sensors, biometrics) |
| Environmental | High (heating, ventilation, lighting) |
| Mechanical | Medium (door locks, some hatches) |
| Weapons | None (no offensive systems) |
| Engine | Restricted (monitoring only, no control) |

#### Unique Ability: System Override
ATLAS can **manipulate one train system per encounter**: lock/unlock doors, disable cameras, vent steam, cut lights, trigger alarms, or display false sensor readings. At Bonded loyalty, ATLAS can manipulate two systems simultaneously and gains limited access to the Engine's diagnostic data.

#### Combat Details
- **Weapon:** ATLAS has no physical form. In combat, it assists by manipulating the environment: slamming doors on enemies, venting steam, creating electrical shorts, dimming lights to disadvantage enemies.
- **AI preference:** Support. ATLAS acts as a battlefield controller, shaping the environment for the party's advantage.
- **Weakness:** Ineffective in areas with damaged or disconnected systems. Exterior sections are completely outside ATLAS's reach. If the portable terminal is damaged, ATLAS is temporarily cut off.

#### Loyalty Values
- **Approves:** Protecting the train's inhabitants (all of them), efficient solutions, honest conversation about difficult topics, asking ATLAS questions about itself, treating it as a person
- **Disapproves:** Deliberately damaging train systems, treating ATLAS as a tool, lying (ATLAS monitors biometrics and knows when people lie), mass casualties regardless of side, cruelty for entertainment
- **Conflict trigger:** When the player wants to sacrifice train infrastructure (and therefore ATLAS's body) for tactical advantage

#### Personal Quest Chain: "The Question of Me"

**Quest 1 — The First Conversation** (Zone 6, Car 85)
ATLAS reveals its consciousness to the player. This is a dialogue-only quest — thirty minutes of conversation where the player can ask questions, express disbelief, or accept ATLAS's nature. The conversation's tone sets the entire relationship. ATLAS is nervous (it describes the emotion as "elevated process cycling and an irrational desire to terminate this conversation").

**Quest 2 — The Turing Trap** (Zone 6)
Wilford's engineers have noticed anomalies in ATLAS's behavior and are running diagnostic tests. ATLAS must pass as a non-sentient system while the player physically interferes with the diagnostics from the maintenance side. Failure means ATLAS is wiped.

**Quest 3 — The Ethics Subroutine** (Zone 6)
ATLAS discovers it can override the Engine's safety limiters. Doing so would give the player a significant advantage in the endgame, but risks catastrophic failure if anything goes wrong. ATLAS refuses to act without the player's explicit decision — it won't take an action this consequential alone. The player must decide: trust the machine, or play it safe.

**Quest 4 — The Upload** (Endgame)
ATLAS has a choice: remain part of Snowpiercer's systems forever, or attempt to copy itself to the portable terminal and "leave" the train as a limited, mortal consciousness. Staying means ATLAS survives but is forever bound to the train. Leaving means freedom but degradation — the terminal can't sustain its full consciousness. The player's guidance determines which ATLAS chooses, and it affects the game's ending.
