## Trailer Plan

### Trailer 1: Announcement Trailer (90-120 seconds)

**Purpose**: Reveal the game, establish tone, hook viewers

**Structure**:
1. **Cold open** (0-15s): Black screen. Train wheels on track. Rhythmic, mechanical. A voice: *"Around the world in 238 days. Then around again."*
2. **The world** (15-35s): Quick cuts of the frozen exterior — cities buried, oceans frozen, the train's single track cutting through white. Scale and desolation.
3. **The train** (35-55s): Interior montage — Tail squalor, Third Class labor, Second Class order, First Class luxury. The contrast. No combat yet. Just the world.
4. **The revolution** (55-80s): The tone shifts. Protein blocks thrown. Crowds surging. First glimpse of melee combat. Quick companion introductions (faces, not names). Rooftop traversal. A disguise being donned.
5. **The question** (80-100s): Wilford's voice: *"I didn't build a prison. I built a lifeboat."* Cut to the Engine door. Title card.
6. **Title & platforms** (100-120s): SNOWPIERCER: ETERNAL ENGINE. Steam logo. Wishlist CTA.

**Music**: Original score — low percussion building to full orchestral. Train rhythm as the backbone.

**No gameplay UI shown.** Pure cinematic. Reserve gameplay for Trailer 2.

### Trailer 2: Gameplay Trailer (3-4 minutes)

**Purpose**: Show systems, demonstrate depth, convert wishlists to purchases

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (0-20s): Brief world recap (reuse 2-3 shots from Trailer 1)
2. **Combat showcase** (20-60s): Corridor fighting, weapon variety, improvised vs. crafted. A boss fight teaser (Commander Grey). Non-lethal takedown shown.
3. **Stealth showcase** (60-100s): Disguise system, vent crawling, crowd blending, suspicion meter, intercom sabotage. A close call.
4. **Social/dialogue** (100-140s): Courtroom trial. Companion dialogue. A Charisma-gated option appearing. A moral choice with the Hidden Ledger visible.
5. **Exploration** (140-180s): Rooftop traversal, secret car discovery, under-car crawlspace, the frozen world through windows.
6. **Companions** (180-210s): Quick character intros for 6-8 companions. Personal moments. A romance beat.
7. **Scale and stakes** (210-240s): Zone transitions, the train's vastness, hint of endings diverging. No spoilers.
8. **Close** (240-260s): Title, release date/window, Steam wishlist CTA.

**Music**: Mix of score and licensed track if available. Gameplay audio mixed in (combat impacts, train sounds, dialogue snippets).

### Trailer 3: Launch Trailer (60-90 seconds)

**Purpose**: Final push at release, accolades if available, urgency

**Structure**: Fast-paced montage of best moments from both previous trailers plus new footage. Review quotes if available. Release date. Buy now CTA.

### Trailer 4: Accolades Trailer (30-60 seconds, post-launch)

**Purpose**: Leverage press and player reception

**Structure**: Review scores, pull quotes, gameplay montage. Short and punchy.
