# Steam Achievements

## Design Principles

- **Total count: 68 achievements** (balanced across categories)
- Hidden achievements for story spoilers (marked [HIDDEN] below)
- No achievements that conflict with each other in a single playthrough
- Completion-focused achievements are achievable without a guide for attentive players
- Combat achievements have both lethal and non-lethal variants to respect playstyle
- Secret car achievements are hidden to preserve discovery
