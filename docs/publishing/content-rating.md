## Content Categories

### Violence — HIGH

**ESRB descriptor**: Blood, Violence
**PEGI descriptor**: Violence

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Melee combat | Close-quarters fighting with improvised and crafted weapons (pipes, axes, cleavers) | High — visceral, impactful animations |
| Blood | Blood splatter on weapons and surfaces during combat; blood pools on corpses | Moderate — present but not gratuitous |
| Death | Enemies and companions can die; bodies remain visible, must be hidden | Moderate |
| Non-lethal option | Full non-lethal playthrough possible; all bosses have non-combat resolution | Mitigating factor |
| Referenced mass violence | The "Third Purge" (execution of 60 Tail residents by cold exposure) is referenced in dialogue and documents | Backstory reference only — not depicted |
| Boss violence | Boss fights involve sustained one-on-one or group combat | High |
| Body disposal | Player hides unconscious/dead bodies to avoid detection | Moderate — mechanical, not gratuitous |

**Assessment**: The corridor combat is intense and personal. Weapons are improvised from industrial materials. Blood is present but not excessive. The non-lethal option is a meaningful alternative, not an afterthought. This is comparable to Dishonored or Deus Ex in violence intensity.

### Drug Use — MODERATE-HIGH

**ESRB descriptor**: Drug Reference
**PEGI descriptor**: Drug Use

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Kronole | A fictional drug central to the narrative — addictive sedative with euphoric properties | High narrative prominence |
| Kronole use depicted | NPCs use Kronole visibly; the Kronole Den in Zone 1 shows active use | Moderate — shown, not glamorized |
| Player Kronole use | Player can consume Kronole for gameplay benefits (healing, buffs) with withdrawal consequences | Player-optional |
| Addiction narrative | Companion Yuki's brother died of Kronole addiction; an addict NPC appears in Zone 3 | Depicted as tragic, not glorified |
| Drug production | Kronole's creation is a plot point; Dr. Park's companion quest involves creating an antidote | Scientific framing |
| Moral choice | Player decides the fate of the Tail's Kronole operation (shut down, regulate, weaponize, or maintain) | Complex — no "right" answer |

**Assessment**: Kronole is a fictional substance but functions identically to a real-world addictive drug. Its use is shown, its consequences are shown, and the player can engage with it mechanically. The game treats addiction as tragic and systemic, not recreational. This is the primary driver of the M/PEGI 18 rating alongside violence.

### Child Endangerment — HIGH (narrative, not interactive)

**ESRB descriptor**: (no standard descriptor; noted in content summary)
**PEGI descriptor**: (addressed in content description)

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Child labor in the Engine | 37 children used as maintenance laborers in Engine access spaces | High emotional impact |
| The Nursery (secret car) | Discovery of the facility where children were measured for Engine access points; smallest uniform fits a 4-year-old | High — the game's moral fulcrum |
| Elevation Program | Children taken from Tail/Third Class and raised as loyal operatives (Melena Voss's backstory) | Moderate — referenced in documents and dialogue |
| Edgar's rations | Companion Edgar has been giving his food rations to children for two years, demonstrating Tail children's starvation | Moderate |
| Children are never harmed on-screen | No depictions of children being hurt, killed, or abused in real-time gameplay | Critical mitigating factor |

**Assessment**: Child exploitation is the game's most emotionally devastating theme, but it is handled with deliberate restraint. The discovery is conveyed through environmental storytelling (the Nursery), documents, and dialogue — never through direct depiction of harm to children. No child characters are harmed in gameplay. This is thematically comparable to BioShock's Little Sisters or The Last of Us's treatment of children in danger, but more focused on systemic exploitation than individual peril.

### Cannibalism References — MODERATE

**ESRB descriptor**: (noted in content summary)
**PEGI descriptor**: (addressed in content description)

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Year 1 "Dark Time" | Historical cannibalism during the Tail's first-year starvation is referenced in dialogue and documents | Reference only — never depicted |
| Protein block composition | Protein blocks contain trace amounts of composted human biological material (revealed in Zone 2) | Disturbing revelation, not visual |
| Body composting | Industrial composting of deceased is the train's waste management system; composted material enters the food supply in trace amounts | Systemic horror, not depicted graphically |
| Zone 7 furnace | Children in Zone 7 observe bodies entering the Engine's auxiliary furnace | Referenced, not a gameplay scene |

**Assessment**: Cannibalism is historical, referenced, and systemic — never depicted visually. The protein block revelation is the most visceral moment, and it's delivered through dialogue/documents, not imagery. The game treats this with gravity consistent with its source material (the Snowpiercer film's protein block scene). Comparable to Fallout's references to cannibalism or The Road's thematic treatment.

### Sexual Content — LOW

**ESRB descriptor**: Suggestive Themes
**PEGI descriptor**: (none required at this level)

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Romance arcs | 4 romanceable companions (Edgar, Yuki, Vivienne, ATLAS) | Relationship-focused, not explicit |
| Physical intimacy | Implied sexual content via fade-to-black; no nudity, no explicit scenes | Minimal |
| ATLAS romance | Explores intimacy without physical form; entirely emotional/intellectual | Unique, non-sexual |
| Suggestive dialogue | Occasional flirtatious or suggestive dialogue in romance paths | Mild |

**Assessment**: Romance content is comparable to Mass Effect or Dragon Age — meaningful relationships with fade-to-black intimacy. No nudity. No explicit sexual content. This alone would not drive a mature rating.

### Language — MODERATE

**ESRB descriptor**: Strong Language
**PEGI descriptor**: Strong Language

| Element | Description | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Profanity | Characters use strong language consistent with survival conditions | Moderate — contextually appropriate |
| Slurs | Class-based slurs (e.g., "Tailie," "grunt") used by antagonists | Fictional slurs, no real-world equivalents |

**Assessment**: Language is realistic for the setting. No gratuitous use. Comparable to most M-rated narrative games.

## IARC Questionnaire Notes

For Steam's IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) integration:

- **Violence**: Realistic violence with blood, against human characters, in a close-quarters context
- **Fear**: Sustained atmospheric tension; jump scares are minimal but the Sanctum zone has horror-adjacent elements
- **Sexuality**: Implied sexual content, no nudity

- **Language**: Strong language (infrequent)
- **Discrimination**: The game depicts class-based discrimination as a central theme, presented critically
- **Gambling**: None
- **In-app purchases**: None
- **User interaction**: None (single-player only; Workshop is user-generated content, not interaction)

## Sensitive Content Toggles

The game provides configurable content toggles to allow players to manage their exposure to sensitive themes. These are accessible from the Settings menu at any time.

| Toggle | Default | Effect When Disabled |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Blood and Gore** | On | Combat blood splatter reduced to impact sparks; blood pools removed from corpses |
| **Drug Use Visuals** | On | Kronole consumption animations replaced with text notification; Kronole Den visual intensity reduced |
| **Cannibalism References** | On | Protein block composition revelation delivered in abstract terms; composting references softened |
| **Child Exploitation Details** | On | The Nursery's most specific details (uniform sizes, measurement records) are generalized; core narrative impact preserved |
| **Body Disposal** | On | Hidden bodies fade out after placement rather than remaining visible |
| **Profanity** | On | Strong language replaced with milder alternatives in subtitles and dialogue |

### Toggle Design Principles
- Toggles reduce intensity, not remove content — the narrative remains coherent with all toggles off
- No toggle removes a moral choice or alters the Hidden Ledger
- No toggle changes gameplay mechanics (Kronole still functions as a healing item regardless of visual toggle)
- Toggles are independent — any combination is valid
- Toggles can be changed at any time without restarting
- Default state (all On) is the intended artistic experience; toggles exist for accessibility, not censorship

### Regional Considerations
- **Germany (USK)**: Blood toggle satisfies potential concerns; no indexing risk with toggle available
- **Australia (ACB)**: Drug use toggle may be relevant; Kronole as fictional substance with consequences supports MA15+ or R18+ rather than Refused Classification
- **Japan (CERO)**: Drug and violence toggles support Z rating compliance
- **China**: Separate content review required; toggles provide flexibility for regional builds if needed
