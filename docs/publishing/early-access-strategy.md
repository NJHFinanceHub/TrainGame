# Early Access Strategy

## Recommendation: Zones 1-3 Early Access Launch

### Decision: YES to Early Access

**Launch with Zones 1-3 (Cars 1-48)** — approximately 40-45% of total content, representing a complete narrative arc from the Tail through Third Class to Second Class.

---

## Rationale

### Why Early Access

1. **Natural segmentation**: The train's zone structure creates clean content boundaries. Zones 1-3 deliver a complete act with rising stakes, three boss encounters, and meaningful resolution points.
2. **Player feedback on moral choices**: The Hidden Ledger is the game's most ambitious system. Early Access lets real players test whether the 12 major choices in Zones 1-3 feel genuinely ambiguous and consequential before the remaining 12 are finalized.
3. **Combat and stealth tuning**: Corridor combat balance and stealth AI behavior need large-scale playtesting that internal QA cannot replicate.
4. **Community building**: A narrative RPG benefits from word-of-mouth. Early Access creates evangelists before full launch.
5. **Revenue runway**: Funding continued development of Zones 4-7, which contain the most technically demanding content (Working Spine, Engine).

### Why Zones 1-3 Specifically

- **Zone 1 (The Tail)**: Tutorial zone, establishes all core mechanics, introduces 4 companions, first boss. Players learn the game.
- **Zone 2 (Third Class)**: Opens up the world, introduces disguise system, faction politics, 2 new companions, crafting depth. Players engage with systems.
- **Zone 3 (Second Class)**: Peaks with the courtroom trial, Melena Voss identity reveal, surveillance moral choice, 2 new companions. Players are hooked.
- **Natural cliffhanger**: Zone 3 ends with access to the Working Spine — the unknown mechanical heart of the train. Players want more.

Early Access lets us put our moral choice system — the Hidden Ledger — in front of real players before we finalize the story's conclusion. Your decisions in Zones 1-3 will directly inform how we design the consequences that play out in Zones 4-7."

> **Will the price change after Early Access?**

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Story spoilers before 1.0 | Zones 1-3 contain no ending spoilers; the Traitor is foreshadowed but not revealed; child labor is hinted but not confirmed |
| Player burnout before full release | Zone updates are substantial (15-20 hours each); stagger updates to maintain interest |
| Negative reviews from incomplete content | Clear "Early Access" messaging; store page explicitly states content scope |
| Save compatibility across updates | Save format designed for forward compatibility; migration scripts for each update |
| Scope creep from player feedback | Feedback informs balance and polish, not new features; feature scope is locked |
