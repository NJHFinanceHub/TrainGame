# Demo Plan

## Scope: Cars 1-14 (Zone 1, Tail Only — Excluding Boss)

### Overview
The demo covers Cars 1-14 of the Tail — the full Zone 1 experience minus the Commander Grey boss fight in Car 15 (Threshold). This showcases all core mechanics, the complete Tail narrative arc, and ends on a cliffhanger at the gates of revolution. Estimated playtime: **3-4 hours**.

## Demo Distribution Strategy

### Timing
- **Steam Next Fest**: Primary demo launch window (align with relevant Next Fest)
- **Permanent demo**: Keep demo available on store page after Next Fest
- **Pre-EA launch**: Demo available 2-4 weeks before Early Access launch to build wishlists

### Store Page Integration
- Demo button prominently placed on store page
- Demo description: "Play 14 cars of the Tail — nearly the entire first zone. Your progress carries to the full game."
- Demo-specific screenshots (if needed): reuse main store screenshots from Zone 1

## Demo-Specific Considerations

### Performance
- Demo should represent final performance targets
- Include benchmark option (run through Cars 1-3 with fixed camera path, report average FPS)
- Settings auto-detect on first launch

### Onboarding
- Tutorial prompts for all mechanics (skippable for returning players)
- Control scheme shown at first input
- Difficulty selection at game start with clear descriptions
- Accessibility settings prompted at first launch

### End-of-Demo Screen
- Summary: cars explored, enemies defeated, companions recruited, collectibles found
- Hidden Ledger snapshot (first moral choice result shown)
- Clear CTA: "Wishlist the full game" / "Buy Early Access now" (context-dependent)
- "Your save will transfer" messaging
- Social sharing: screenshot of summary screen with game branding

### Analytics (opt-in)
- Track which mechanics players engage with most
- Track demo completion rate
- Track difficulty tier selection distribution
- Track accessibility feature usage
- Track where players stop playing (car-by-car dropout)
- All analytics opt-in with clear disclosure
