# Demo Plan

## Scope: Cars 1-10 (Zone 1 Partial)

### Overview
The demo covers the first 10 cars of the Tail — enough to introduce all core mechanics, establish the world, and end on a hook that drives wishlists. Estimated playtime: **2-3 hours**.

## Demo Content

### Narrative
- Player character creation (background selection, appearance)
- Introduction to the Tail's daily life: protein block distribution, Jackboot patrols, cramped living
- The inciting incident: the revolution's spark
- First moral choice encounter (the antibiotic triage decision)
- Introduction to the Kronole situation (setup only, not the full den choice)
- Ends at Car 10 with a clear "the revolution has begun" moment and a "Continue in the full game" transition

### Mechanics Introduced
| Mechanic | Cars | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Melee combat** | Cars 3-4 | First Jackboot encounter, improvised weapons |
| **Stealth basics** | Cars 5-6 | Hiding spots, basic detection, first locker hide |
| **Dialogue system** | Cars 1-2, 7-8 | NPC conversations, first Charisma check (low threshold) |
| **Crafting (intro)** | Car 6 | First workbench, basic weapon crafting from scrap |
| **Exploration** | Cars 8-10 | First non-linear car with multiple paths, a vent route, a locked door |
| **Collectibles** | Cars 1-10 | ~10 collectibles (Train Logs, an Audio Recording, an Artifact) |

### Companions in Demo
- **Marta Vasquez** joins in Car 2 (tutorial companion, demonstrates healing)
- **Edgar Kowalski** joins in Car 5 (demonstrates melee combat companion AI)

### Boss: None
- Commander Grey is the Zone 1 boss at Car 15 — the demo ends before reaching him
- The demo's climactic moment is the first coordinated Jackboot fight in Car 9-10 (4v4 corridor battle)

## Demo Restrictions

| Feature | Demo Status |
|---------|-------------|
| Save system | Enabled — saves carry forward to full game |
| Difficulty tiers | All 4 available (demonstrates range) |
| Accessibility | Full suite available (demonstrates commitment) |
| Settings | Full graphics/audio/control options |
| Steam achievements | Disabled in demo |
| Collectible tracking | Tracked, carries to full game |
| Hidden Ledger | Active, carries to full game |

### Save Transfer
- Demo saves are fully compatible with the full game (Early Access and 1.0)
- Player character, inventory, moral choices, and collectible progress carry over
- Clear messaging at demo end: "Your progress will transfer to the full game"
- Technical: save format includes a `demo_version` flag for migration if needed

## Demo Distribution Strategy

### Timing
- **Steam Next Fest**: Primary demo launch window (align with relevant Next Fest)
- **Permanent demo**: Keep demo available on store page after Next Fest
- **Pre-EA launch**: Demo available 2-4 weeks before Early Access launch to build wishlists

### Store Page Integration
- Demo button prominently placed on store page
- Demo description: "Play the first 10 cars of the Tail. Your progress carries to the full game."
- Demo-specific screenshots (if needed): reuse main store screenshots from Zone 1

## Demo-Specific Considerations

### Performance
- Demo should represent final performance targets
- Include benchmark option (run through Cars 1-3 with fixed camera path, report average FPS)
- Settings auto-detect on first launch

### Onboarding
- Tutorial prompts for all mechanics (skippable for returning players)
- Control scheme shown at first input
- Difficulty selection at game start with clear descriptions
- Accessibility settings prompted at first launch

### End-of-Demo Screen
- Summary: cars explored, enemies defeated, companions recruited, collectibles found
- Hidden Ledger snapshot (first moral choice result shown)
- Clear CTA: "Wishlist the full game" / "Buy Early Access now" (context-dependent)
- "Your save will transfer" messaging
- Social sharing: screenshot of summary screen with game branding

### Analytics (opt-in)
- Track which mechanics players engage with most
- Track demo completion rate
- Track difficulty tier selection distribution
- Track accessibility feature usage
- Track where players stop playing (car-by-car dropout)
- All analytics opt-in with clear disclosure
