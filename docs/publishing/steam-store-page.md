## Long Description (About This Game)

### THE LAST TRAIN. THE LAST PEOPLE. THE LAST CHANCE.

Seventeen years ago, a geoengineering catastrophe froze the Earth. The only survivors — 3,200 souls — boarded Snowpiercer, a thousand-car train that never stops. The wealthy ride in First Class. The workers grind in Third. And in the Tail, 700 people were packed into cars with no food, no water, and no heat.

You are one of them. You have survived seventeen years of darkness. Now you're going to walk 103 cars toward the Engine — and tear this world apart on the way.

### A REVOLUTION IN SEVEN ZONES

Snowpiercer is a thousand-car microcosm of human civilization, divided into seven zones — each with its own politics, culture, and power structure. Progress from the rusting squalor of the Tail through industrial Third Class, bureaucratic Second Class, the mechanical labyrinth of the Working Spine, gilded First Class, the zealot-controlled Sanctum, and finally the Engine itself.

Each zone is gatekept by a boss who believes — genuinely believes — they are doing what's right. Defeat them by force, outmaneuver them through stealth, or dismantle their convictions through dialogue and evidence. Every boss has a non-combat resolution. Whether you use it is up to you.

### COMBAT, STEALTH, AND SOCIAL WARFARE

**Fight** through claustrophobic train corridors with improvised melee weapons, progressing from sharpened pipes to military-grade arms. Every swing matters in tight spaces.

**Sneak** through vents, maintenance crawlspaces, and across the frozen exterior. Disguise yourself in zone-appropriate uniforms. Blend into crowds. Disable intercoms to prevent alert cascades.

**Talk** your way through crises. A silent protagonist with authored dialogue choices — not tone tags, but full sentences. Charisma-gated options open paths that combat cannot. Win a courtroom trial. Expose a secret identity. Make a deal with the devil in silk.

### TWELVE COMPANIONS, TWELVE STORIES

Recruit up to 12 companions across the train — each with a personal quest, a hidden secret, and the capacity to die permanently if you aren't careful. A surgeon who has killed to save. A 16-year-old engineer building a radio to signal the outside world. An AI that developed consciousness and has been hiding it for fourteen years. A woman who survived eleven years *outside the train*.

Four companions are romanceable. All twelve will remember what you did — and what you didn't do.

### EVERY CHOICE COSTS SOMETHING

The Hidden Ledger tracks your moral decisions across five axes — Mercy vs. Pragmatism, Individual vs. Collective, Truth vs. Stability, Force vs. Cunning, Present vs. Future. Twenty-four major choices shape the Ledger. None have obviously correct answers. Consequences arrive cars later, zones later, endings later.

Six endings. Two secret endings. No final menu — your ending is determined by who you were across 103 cars, not which button you press at the end.

### A WORLD BEYOND THE GLASS

The frozen Earth is visible through every window. Watch it change. The game never tells you what you're seeing. Pay attention — the world outside may matter more than the world inside.

Nine secret cars are hidden throughout the train. Find them all, and the full truth emerges.
