# Protagonist Design

## Identity: Custom Character

The player creates their own character rather than playing a pre-named protagonist. This reinforces the Tail's themes — in the Tail, individuality is crushed. You are nobody until you make yourself somebody.

### Character Creation

**Name:** Player-chosen. NPCs use it sparingly — most Tailies call you by nicknames earned through play ("the new blood", "the quiet one", "the butcher" depending on playstyle).

**Appearance:** Limited customization reflecting Tail reality:
- Face presets (8 options, diverse ethnicities) — no slider soup
- Hair (short/practical options only — long hair is a liability)
- Scars/markings (optional)
- Body type: two builds (lean, stocky) — nobody in the Tail is well-fed
- Age range: 20s-40s

**Gender:** Male/female/non-binary. Affects NPC dialogue lines but never locks content.

**Background:** Choose one origin that sets starting stat bonuses and unlocks a unique dialogue option tree:

| Background | Description | Stat Bonus | Unique Perk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brawler** | Fought in the Pit for extra rations since day one | +2 STR, +1 END | *Pit Dog* — Unarmed attacks deal +15% damage |
| **Scavenger** | Survived by finding what others missed | +2 PER, +1 CUN | *Rat's Eye* — Lootable items glow faintly |
| **Caretaker** | Protected the Tail's children and elderly | +2 CHA, +1 SRV | *Trusted Face* — NPCs share information more freely |
| **Mechanic** | Kept the Tail's meager infrastructure running | +2 CUN, +1 STR | *Jury-Rig* — Crafted items have +20% durability |
| **Ghost** | Nobody remembers when you arrived. You like it that way. | +2 SRV, +1 PER | *Unnoticed* — Detection radius reduced by 10% |

### Backstory Integration

The player has been in the Tail for **7 years** (boarded at the last station before the Freeze). Key backstory beats are revealed through:
- **Memory fragments** — Triggered by environmental interactions (seeing snow, hearing music, finding pre-Freeze objects). Short flashback vignettes, not cutscenes.
- **NPC recognition** — Certain NPCs knew you before the train. Their dialogue reveals your past organically.
- **The Journal** — Optional collectible: the player character's journal entries from years 1-6. Found scattered across the Tail (they were confiscated and redistributed as scrap paper).

The player's pre-Freeze life is deliberately vague. You remember fragments. The cold took the rest. This lets the player project onto the character while maintaining authored backstory beats.

### Voice

**Silent protagonist with authored dialogue choices.** The player character does not speak aloud but selects from 2-4 dialogue options. Options are full sentences (no "sarcastic" mystery labels). Tone is shaped by player choice, not pre-recorded performance.

### Narrative Arc

The protagonist's arc is defined by player choices but follows a structural backbone:
1. **Tail (Zone 1):** Nobody → Reluctant participant in Gilliam's revolution
2. **Third Class (Zone 2):** Revolutionary → Confronted with moral complexity of uprising
3. **Second Class (Zone 3):** Infiltrator → Forced to adopt the enemy's methods
4. **Working Spine (Zone 4):** Survivor → Understanding how the train actually works
5. **First Class (Zone 5):** Intruder → Tempted by comfort, disgusted by excess
6. **Sanctum (Zone 6):** Heretic or convert → The Engine's truth begins to emerge
7. **Engine (Zone 7):** The choice → What do you do with the truth?

## Starting Stats

All stats begin at **5** (scale 1-20). Background adds bonuses. Starting total: **32 points** (30 base + 3 from background).

| Stat | Starting Value |
|---|---|
| Strength | 5 |
| Endurance | 5 |
| Cunning | 5 |
| Charisma | 5 |
| Perception | 5 |
| Survival | 5 |

Plus background bonuses (see table above).

No additional point allocation at character creation. The Tail made you — your choices going forward define who you become.
