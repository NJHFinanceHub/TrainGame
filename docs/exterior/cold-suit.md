# Cold Suit System

Cold suits are specialized EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) equipment enabling the player
to survive exterior exposure. They are the primary gate for rooftop traversal, exterior
objectives, and the endgame exit sequence.

## Cold Suit Tiers

### Mk.I — Improvised Insulation

- **Acquisition**: Craftable in Zone 2 (Third Class workshops). Requires: 3× Thermal
  Fabric (salvaged from insulation panels) + 2× Sealant Paste + 1× Breather Mask.
  Blueprint obtained from Anvil (Tail weapons master) or discovered in maintenance
  locker (Car 18).
- **Appearance**: Layered fabric wraps over existing clothing. Goggles. Cloth face
  covering. Visible seams and patches. Looks desperate, improvised, Tail-made.
- **Stats**:
  - Time limit: 120 seconds exterior exposure before frostbite stage 1
  - Cold resistance: +60 seconds per frostbite stage (total safe window: ~3 min)
  - Wind resistance: 20% (reduces wind drift by 20%)
  - Movement speed: 90% of base (slight bulk penalty)
  - Combat: -10% attack speed (bulky gloves reduce grip)
  - Noise: Quiet (fabric doesn't clatter)
  - Carry weight: 4 kg equipped
- **Limitations**: Insufficient for blizzard conditions. Whiteout is lethal. No
  protection below -75°C effective temperature (Siberian/Bering segments in any
  weather). Degrades 5% durability per exterior excursion. Repairable with
  Thermal Fabric (1 unit per 25% repair).
- **Use case**: Short rooftop crossings in mild weather. Accessing heated vents
  between cars. Emergency exterior escapes.

### Mk.II — Engineering Cold Suit

- **Acquisition**: Found or awarded in Zone 4 (Working Spine). Two paths:
  - **Engineering path** (CUN 10+): Complete the "Cold Lab Access" quest. The suit
    is in the Cold Lab equipment locker, intended for exterior sensor maintenance.
  - **Combat path** (STR 12+): Take it from a Breachman patrol. Breachmen are elite
    hull maintenance workers who use these suits regularly. Defeating a Breachman
    patrol (3 enemies, tough fight) drops one suit.
  - **Social path** (CHA 12+): Convince Chief Engineer Mara that you need exterior
    access for a legitimate purpose. She issues one from stores.
- **Appearance**: Proper engineered suit. Insulated layers with sealed seams. Full
  face helmet with visor. Integrated heating coils (powered by small battery pack
  on back). Reflective exterior surface. Looks professional, functional, Cold War
  surplus adapted for the train.
- **Stats**:
  - Time limit: 240 seconds exterior exposure before frostbite stage 1
  - Cold resistance: +120 seconds per frostbite stage (total safe window: ~8 min)
  - Wind resistance: 50% (sealed suit resists wind penetration)
  - Movement speed: 80% of base (heavier, more rigid)
  - Combat: -20% attack speed, -15% dodge (rigid suit restricts movement)
  - Sprint: Available but drains suit battery (reduces remaining time by 2× while
    sprinting)
  - Noise: Normal (battery pack hums, suit creaks)
  - Carry weight: 8 kg equipped
  - Battery: 10 minutes of heating. Rechargeable at any electrical junction (5 min
    charge time). Battery depletion removes heating bonus—suit functions as Mk.I.
- **Limitations**: Blizzard conditions reduce effective time by 40%. Whiteout reduces
  to 25% (survivable but dangerous). Battery dependency creates planning requirements.
  Combat is viable but disadvantaged. Repairable with Engineering Kit + 1 Battery Cell.
- **Use case**: Extended rooftop traversal. Exterior objective completion. Car-to-car
  bypass in restricted zones. Landmark observation from rooftop.

### Mk.III — Breachman Exosuit

- **Acquisition**: Late Zone 5 or Zone 6. Single acquisition:
  - **Quest**: "The Last Breachman" — Help or defeat Marcus, the last surviving
    original Breachman (pre-Freeze trained hull walker). His suit is the prototype
    all others were copied from, maintained for 17 years with obsessive care.
    - **Help Marcus** (CHA 14+ or complete his companion quest): He gives you the
      suit willingly and teaches you Breachman techniques (+10% rooftop movement
      speed permanent bonus). The suit comes with Marcus's maintenance log—a
      journal entry about the man who walked the hull alone for 17 years.
    - **Take from Marcus** (combat): Difficult fight (Marcus is elite). Suit
      acquired but no movement bonus. No journal entry. Marcus dies.
- **Appearance**: Military-grade exosuit. Articulated joints with servo-assisted
  movement. Full environmental seal. Heated visor with HUD overlay showing
  temperature, wind speed, frostbite timer. Magnetic boots (togglable). Matte
  black with orange safety markings. Looks like it belongs outside.
- **Stats**:
  - Time limit: 480 seconds exterior exposure before frostbite stage 1
  - Cold resistance: +180 seconds per frostbite stage (total safe window: ~16 min)
  - Wind resistance: 80% (near-complete wind protection)
  - Movement speed: 95% of base (servo-assisted movement compensates for weight)
  - Combat: -5% attack speed (servos assist grip), +10% melee damage (suit weight
    behind strikes), normal dodge
  - Sprint: Full sprint available. No battery drain (nuclear microcell power).
  - Magnetic boots: Toggle on/off. When active: immune to wind knockdown, can walk
    on hull exterior (vertical surfaces), but movement speed drops to 60%.
  - Noise: Loud (servos whine, boots clank on metal)
  - Carry weight: 12 kg equipped (feels like 6 kg due to servo assist)
  - Power: Nuclear microcell. Effectively unlimited duration on heating. The 480s
    limit is biological (suit keeps you warm; your body still loses core temp
    through respiration and visor seal imperfections).
- **Limitations**: Noise makes stealth impossible on rooftop. Whiteout is survivable
  but movement restricted to 40% (wind force overwhelms servos). Cannot fit through
  standard ventilation shafts (too bulky for under-car crawlspace). Repairable only
  at Engineering workbench with Military Kit + Servo Parts.
- **Use case**: All exterior objectives. Extended hull walks. Endgame exterior
  sequences. The Atlantic Crossing rooftop (only suit that survives it). Endgame
  exit if player chooses to leave the train.

### Mk.IV — Exodus Suit (Endgame Only)

- **Acquisition**: Craftable only in Zone 7 if the player has: Mk.III suit + Cold Lab
  environmental data + Shelter Coordinates + Engineer skill tree Tier 3 ("Master
  Engineer"). Built at the Engine Room workbench.
- **Appearance**: Modified Mk.III with additional thermal layers, extended air
  filtration, and a pack frame for carrying supplies. The visor HUD shows a compass
  bearing to the Shelter. Looks like expedition gear—something designed not for a
  maintenance walk but for a journey.
- **Stats**:
  - Time limit: Effectively unlimited in Zone 7 temperate conditions (-7°C). In
    colder segments: 900 seconds before frostbite stage 1.
  - All other stats as Mk.III but with:
    - +50% carry capacity (pack frame)
    - Compass HUD pointing to Shelter
    - Water reclamation (no thirst drain while worn)
    - Air filtration (immune to environmental toxins/gas)
  - **This suit is designed for leaving the train, not for train operations.**
- **Limitations**: Only available in endgame. Cannot be acquired if player lacks
  Engineer Tier 3. The Mk.III is sufficient for all in-game objectives; the Mk.IV
  is for the journey after.

## Acquisition Flow

The cold suit progression is paced to match exterior content unlocking:

```
Zone 1 (Tail)     → No suit. Exterior = instant death. Windows only.
Zone 2 (Third)    → Mk.I available. Short rooftop dashes in calm weather.
Zone 3 (Second)   → Mk.I still current. Better windows for observation.
Zone 4 (Spine)    → Mk.II available. Extended exterior exploration.
Zone 5 (First)    → Mk.II sufficient. Mk.III quest begins.
Zone 6 (Sanctum)  → Mk.III available. All exterior content accessible.
Zone 7 (Engine)   → Mk.IV craftable. Endgame exit enabled.
```
