# Exterior Objectives

Exterior objectives are gameplay sequences requiring the player to leave the train's
interior and operate on the hull, rooftop, or adjacent exterior structures while wearing
a cold suit. Each objective is designed around the cold suit tier available at that
story zone.

## Objective Categories

### Hull Repair

Structural damage to the train's exterior requires manual repair. These objectives
combine traversal, time pressure (frostbite timer), and mechanical interaction.

#### "Patch Job" (Zone 2 — Third Class)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.I minimum
- **Context**: A hull breach in Car 22 is letting cold air into Third Class sleeping
  quarters. Temperatures have dropped 8°C inside. Workers are getting sick. Jackboots
  won't authorize repair (not their section). The player must do it.
- **Objective**: Climb to rooftop via maintenance hatch (Car 20). Traverse 2 cars
  forward along rooftop. Locate breach (visible as a dark gap with vapor venting
  outward). Apply Sealant Paste (3 uses) and Patch Plate (crafted or looted).
- **Time pressure**: Mk.I gives ~3 minutes of safe exterior time. The traversal takes
  ~90 seconds. Repair interaction takes ~45 seconds. Total margin: ~45 seconds.
  Tight but achievable. A heated vent between Car 20 and 21 provides a safe spot
  to pause and let the frostbite timer partially reset.
- **Hazards**: Heavy snow weather (standard for this zone). Wind drift toward the
  left rail. One section of rooftop has ice buildup—slippery surface, reduced movement
  speed (60% for 5 meters).
- **Reward**: Third Class worker reputation +15. Access to Car 22 storage room
  (previously sealed due to cold—contains a T2 weapon blueprint). Worker NPCs in
  the area become friendly.
- **Failure**: If frostbite reaches stage 3+, player auto-retreats to nearest hatch.
  Hull breach remains. Workers' health deteriorates over time (NPC dialogue changes,
  background coughing increases). Can retry.

#### "The Crack" (Zone 4 — Working Spine)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.II minimum
- **Context**: A stress fracture in the hull near Car 48 is propagating toward a
  critical power conduit. If it reaches the conduit, half the Working Spine loses
  power. Chief Engineer Mara needs someone to weld it shut from outside.
- **Objective**: Exit via engineering airlock (Car 47). Traverse hull exterior—not
  rooftop but the hull's side surface, using maintenance handholds. Reach the
  fracture (2m long, glowing faintly with interior light). Apply Arc Welder
  (provided by Mara) along the crack. Three weld points, each requiring a 10-second
  hold interaction.
- **Time pressure**: Mk.II gives ~8 minutes. Traversal: ~2 minutes. Welding: ~1
  minute total. Margin comfortable unless complications occur.
- **Hazards**: The hull side has no railing. Wind gusts can push player off handholds
  (QTE to re-grip, 3-second window). During welding, the arc welder creates sparks
  that temporarily blind the player (screen whiteout for 1 second per weld). One
  weld point is near a steam vent that activates mid-repair (dodge or take 10% HP
  burn damage + frostbite timer acceleration).
- **Complication**: Midway through repair, a second crack appears 3 meters further
  along the hull. Mara radios: "Can you reach it?" Player choice: weld the second
  crack (extending time outside by ~3 minutes, pushing Mk.II limits) or retreat and
  report. Welding both: full repair, Mara's trust, bonus Engineering XP. Welding
  only the first: partial repair, conduit saved but Mara notes the remaining weakness.
- **Reward**: Mara's trust (unlocks Mk.II cold suit via social path if not yet
  obtained). Engineering XP (150). Access to Cold Lab data terminal (key thaw evidence).

#### "Atlantic Patch" (Zone 5 — First Class, Atlantic Crossing)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.III (Mk.II is insufficient—wind force on the Atlantic
  Bridge exceeds Mk.II's wind resistance)
- **Context**: During the Atlantic Crossing, ice buildup on the forward coupling
  between Car 72 and 73 threatens to freeze the articulation joint. If the joint
  seizes, the train cannot navigate the slight curve at the Atlantic Bridge's midpoint.
  A Breachman would handle this, but Marcus is injured (or dead, depending on player
  choices).
- **Objective**: Exit via First Class observation deck (Car 74, retractable glass
  roof). Descend to coupling level via hull ladder. Clear ice from the joint using
  a Thermal Lance (single-use tool, provided by Working Spine). The ice is 30cm
  thick and must be cleared from three joint segments.
- **Time pressure**: Mk.III gives ~16 minutes. Traversal: ~3 minutes. Ice clearing:
  ~5 minutes (3 segments × ~90 seconds each). Margin is comfortable IF weather holds.
- **Hazards**: Atlantic Bridge wind: extreme (100-140 km/h sustained). Even with
  Mk.III's 80% wind resistance, lateral drift is significant. Magnetic boots
  recommended (reduces speed to 60% but prevents knockoff). The coupling area is
  below rooftop level—partially sheltered from direct wind but channeled air creates
  unpredictable gusts. A section of the hull ladder is coated in black ice (invisible
  until stepped on—player slides 2 meters, QTE to catch rung).
- **Complication**: A wave of spray ice (frozen ocean spray carried by wind) hits
  during the second joint segment. 15-second visibility blackout. If magnetic boots
  are off, player is pushed 1 meter laterally. Frostbite timer jumps by 30 seconds.
- **Reward**: Prevents train derailment (narrative consequence). Reputation with
  Working Spine crew (+25). Access to First Class restricted car (Car 71, Wilford's
  private observation car—normally locked, crew grants access in gratitude).

### Car Bypass

When interior routes are blocked (locked doors, hostile patrols, collapsed passages),
exterior traversal provides an alternative path.

#### "Over the Wall" (Zone 2 — Third Class)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.I minimum
- **Context**: The Blockade at Car 15 is the barrier between Tail-controlled and
  Jackboot-controlled Third Class. The interior passage is a kill zone. Gilliam needs
  someone to go over.
- **Objective**: Exit to rooftop at Car 13 (Tail side). Traverse rooftop across Cars
  14 and 15 (the Blockade). Drop through a maintenance hatch on Car 16 (Third Class
  side). The hatch is rusted shut—requires STR 8 or a Pry Bar to open.
- **Time pressure**: Mk.I gives ~3 minutes. Traversal: ~2 minutes. Hatch interaction:
  15 seconds. Margin thin.
- **Hazards**: Car 15 rooftop has a Jackboot observation post (1 guard with spotlight).
  The guard sweeps the rooftop on a 20-second cycle. Player must time crossing to avoid
  the sweep. If spotted: guard fires warning shot (no damage but alerts interior
  patrols). Player has 10 seconds to reach the far hatch before a full response.
  Stealth-specced players (Soft Steps + Shadow Blend) can cross during the sweep
  undetected.
- **Alternative**: A maintenance cable runs along the hull side between Cars 13 and
  16, below rooftop level. Requires PER 10 to notice, CUN 8 to use safely. Slower
  (3 minutes traversal) but invisible to the guard. Barely possible with Mk.I timing—
  player arrives at Car 16 with 15-20 seconds of margin.
- **Reward**: Bypass the Blockade without combat (massive strategic advantage). Access
  to Third Class from the safe side. Opens a route for Tail reinforcements if player
  later unlocks the hatch from inside.

#### "The Dark Car Crossing" (Zone 3 — Second Class)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.I minimum (rooftop sections) + flashlight (interior)
- **Context**: Car 10 (The Dark Car) is powered down and home to The Forgotten (feral
  community). Interior passage is possible but dangerous (The Forgotten are hostile
  to outsiders). The rooftop bypass requires crossing over the Dark Car and adjacent
  unpowered cars.
- **Objective**: Hybrid interior/exterior route. Exit to rooftop at Car 9. Cross
  rooftop of Cars 10-11 (unpowered, no interior heat = hull surface colder than
  normal, -10°C modifier to frostbite timer). Re-enter at Car 12 via emergency
  hatch.
- **Time pressure**: Mk.I: ~2.5 minutes effective (cold modifier). Traversal: ~2
  minutes. Tight.
- **Hazards**: Cars 10-11 rooftop is unmaintained. Loose panels shift underfoot
  (audio creak warns, then panel gives—QTE to jump to stable surface or fall
  through into The Dark Car interior). If player falls through: must navigate Dark
  Car interior (stealth or combat vs. The Forgotten) to reach Car 12 from inside.
  Falling through voids the exterior objective but opens the Dark Car interior
  content.
- **Reward**: Clean bypass of The Dark Car zone. If combined with stealth: no
  faction reputation loss with The Forgotten (they never knew you were there).

#### "Sanctum Bypass" (Zone 6 — The Sanctum)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.III (Mk.II technically survivable but combat risk
  makes the time margin too thin)
- **Context**: The Gauntlet (Sanctum elite guard) controls access between Cars 92
  and 95. The interior is a death maze of checkpoints, surveillance, and fanatic
  guards. The rooftop is unmonitored—the Order never imagined anyone would go outside
  to bypass them.
- **Objective**: Exit via hidden maintenance access in Car 91 (Breachman tunnel
  connection, requires Breachman faction standing NEUTRAL or higher, or lockpick
  CUN 14+). Traverse rooftop across Cars 92-95 (4 cars, longest exterior bypass
  in the game). Enter Car 96 via an access panel that was welded shut—requires Arc
  Welder or Thermal Lance to cut through (45-second interaction).
- **Time pressure**: Mk.III: ~16 minutes. Traversal: ~5 minutes. Panel cutting: ~45
  seconds. Generous margin—the challenge is hazards, not time.
- **Hazards**: Car 93 rooftop has a ceremonial skylight (glass panel in roof). The
  Order holds services below. If player walks on the glass: it holds (reinforced) but
  Order members below look up and see the player's silhouette. 30-second window before
  guards are dispatched to rooftop. Running across the glass panel makes noise audible
  below. Crouching and moving slowly: safe passage, no detection. Car 94 has external
  sensor equipment (antennae, dishes). These create a maze of obstacles—slower movement,
  tight gaps, suit snag risk (Mk.III's bulk makes this tight—one QTE per obstacle,
  failure = 5% suit durability damage + 3 seconds lost).
- **Reward**: Complete bypass of The Gauntlet. Access to Sanctum inner ring without
  combat or social manipulation. If undetected: Order doesn't know the player has
  penetrated their perimeter (massive advantage for subsequent quests).

### Frozen Structure Retrieval

Objectives requiring the player to access structures adjacent to the track, retrieving
items or data from the frozen world outside.

#### "The Signal Box" (Zone 4 — Working Spine)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.II minimum
- **Context**: A railway signal box 15 meters from the track contains a manual track
  switch. The switch hasn't been used in 17 years, but the train's current route
  includes a junction where the switch could divert to an alternate track—one that
  bypasses the deteriorating Bering Strait section. The switch must be thrown manually.
  Problem: the train can't stop. The player must jump from the moving train, reach the
  signal box, throw the switch, and re-board.
- **Timing**: The train passes the signal box at reduced speed (50 km/h for the
  junction approach). The player has approximately 45 seconds from jump to the point
  where re-boarding becomes impossible (train has passed beyond running distance).
- **Objective sequence**:
  1. Jump from maintenance platform (Car 47) while train is decelerating for junction.
     Landing in snow—1 meter drop, no damage, but deep snow reduces movement to 70%.
  2. Sprint 15 meters to signal box. Door frozen shut—kick open (STR 8) or use Thermal
     Lance on hinges (10 seconds).
  3. Interior: switch lever frozen in position. Apply Thermal Lance to thaw mechanism
     (8 seconds). Pull lever (STR 10 or two attempts at STR 7+).
  4. Sprint back to track. The train is passing—grab maintenance ladder on a specific
     car (timing window: 5-second QTE, forgiving hitbox).
- **Failure modes**: Miss the re-boarding: the train leaves without you. Fade to black.
  Wake up back on the train—companions pulled you back at the last car (you were
  dragged 50 meters). Take 25% HP damage. Switch was thrown successfully if you
  reached step 3. The narrative treats this as a near-death experience; companions
  react with concern/anger. If you didn't reach step 3: switch not thrown, junction
  not available. Re-attempt impossible (the junction is behind you now; next circuit
  in NG+).
- **Reward**: Alternate route unlocked for endgame. The alternate track bypasses Bering
  and routes through a mountain pass—shorter, more sheltered, but hasn't been maintained.
  Opens an additional endgame path.

#### "The Black Box" (Zone 5 — First Class)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.II minimum (Mk.III recommended)
- **Context**: The Dead Trains landmark (Leg 2) includes a derailed passenger train.
  Its onboard computer may contain the last communications from the outside world—
  radio intercepts, emergency broadcasts, government collapse records. A historian
  in Second Class (Dr. Lena Voss) has been trying to access this data for years.
  The train passes within 8 meters of the wreck.
- **Timing**: 4-minute pass-by. The player must exit, reach the wreck, extract the
  data module, and return before the train passes beyond re-boarding range.
- **Objective sequence**:
  1. Exit via rooftop during the Dead Trains pass-by. Descend hull ladder to track
     level. Jump from train to snowbank adjacent to wreck (2-meter gap at 80 km/h—
     requires timing, auto-roll on landing, 10% HP impact damage).
  2. Enter wrecked passenger train through frozen-open door. Interior: frozen in
     time. Passengers in seats, frost-covered. Personal belongings scattered. A
     child's drawing on a tray table. The player cannot interact with most objects—
     this is not a looting opportunity, it's a graveyard.
  3. Reach the engine compartment. The black box (actually orange, per aviation
     convention) is bolted behind a panel. CUN 10 to identify it. Pry bar or STR
     12 to extract it. 20-second interaction.
  4. Return to track. The train is still passing (player is at car ~62-65 of 103).
     Sprint to trackside. Grab maintenance ladder on a passing car (same QTE as
     Signal Box, but at higher speed—tighter window).
- **Failure modes**: Miss re-boarding: same fade-to-black rescue as Signal Box but
  with higher damage (35% HP—higher speed impact). Black box data still obtained
  if extracted before re-board failure. If player spends too long inside the wreck
  (exploring instead of extracting), re-boarding window closes—creates tension
  between curiosity and survival.
- **Reward**: Black box data delivered to Dr. Voss. Contains: final government
  emergency broadcasts (lore codex entries), military communications about CW-7
  deployment (confirms it was deliberate, not accidental), and one personal message—
  a radio operator's last words to their family. Dr. Voss cries. Journal entry:
  "The Last Broadcast." Unlocks dialogue options in Zone 6 (evidence against
  Wilford's narrative).

#### "The Shelter Probe" (Zone 6 — The Sanctum)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.III
- **Context**: The Shelter is visible from the train but its status is unknown. Is
  it intact? Occupied? Functional? The Cold Lab has Shelter coordinates and a
  dormant radio frequency. A directional antenna on the train's hull could transmit
  a probe signal—if someone goes outside to aim it.
- **Objective**: Climb to Car 55 rooftop (Working Spine). Locate the dormant
  directional antenna (large dish, frost-covered, pointing skyward). Realign it
  toward the Shelter's coordinates (interaction: 30-second calibration minigame—
  adjust azimuth and elevation using controller/keys to match target coordinates
  displayed on suit HUD). Activate transmission (10-second hold).
- **Time pressure**: Mk.III provides ample time. The challenge is precision, not
  speed.
- **Hazards**: The antenna is at the highest point on the train's rooftop. Maximum
  wind exposure. During calibration, the player is stationary and vulnerable to
  wind gusts (QTE interruptions every 15 seconds—fail = calibration resets 30%).
  If weather is blizzard or worse: calibration impossible (wind disrupts aim).
  Player must wait for weather to clear or return later.
- **Complication**: The transmission gets a response. A 3-second automated signal:
  "SHELTER ACTIVE. CAPACITY: 200. AWAITING ARRIVAL." The player's suit HUD records
  it. This information transforms the endgame: the Shelter is real, functional,
  and has room.
- **Reward**: Shelter confirmation. Unlocks the "Exodus" ending path. The recorded
  signal can be played for NPCs—reactions vary dramatically. Tailies: hope. Workers:
  planning. First Class: panic (they might lose their position). Order: heresy.
  Wilford: silence.

### Endgame Exit

The final exterior sequence. Only accessible in Zone 7 during the endgame resolution.

#### "Leaving" (Zone 7 — The Engine)

- **Cold suit requirement**: Mk.III minimum (Mk.IV optimal)
- **Context**: The player has confronted Wilford. The choice has been made: leave the
  train. This is not a simple step outside—it's a permanent departure. The train
  cannot stop. The player must exit at a specific point on the route where the
  Shelter is within walking distance.
- **Objective sequence**:
  1. **Preparation** (interior): Gather supplies at the Engine Room workbench.
     Food (3 days minimum), water, medical supplies, tools. If Mk.IV suit available:
     craft it now. If companions are coming: each needs a cold suit (Mk.II minimum;
     the game provides enough materials if player has been thorough).
  2. **The Walk to the Door** (interior): Traverse the full length of the train from
     Engine to the designated exit point (Car 35, a cargo car with a manually
     operable exterior door). This is a 15-minute walk through every zone in reverse.
     NPCs react to the player's visible departure gear. Some cheer. Some beg the
     player to stay. Some try to block the path. Some ask to come along. This
     sequence is scripted but responsive to faction standings and relationship states.
  3. **The Door** (transition): Car 35's cargo door. Manual release. The player opens
     it. Wind and light flood in. The temperature display reads -7°C. Cold, but
     livable. The world outside is visible: snow-patched hills, grey sky, and in the
     distance—a mountain with a structure on its slope. The Shelter.
  4. **The Jump** (exterior): The train is moving at 60 km/h (slowed for a mountain
     pass). The player jumps into a snowbank adjacent to the track. Landing: roll,
     15% HP damage (10% with Mk.IV). Stand up. The train passes. Car after car after
     car. It takes 4 minutes for the full train to pass. The player watches it go.
     The last car—the Tail—passes. Its small windows are lit. A face appears briefly.
     Then it's gone.
  5. **The Walk** (exterior, playable epilogue): The player walks toward the Shelter.
     The cold suit timer is running but generous (Mk.III: 16 min, Mk.IV: 30 min+).
     The walk takes approximately 8 minutes of real time. No enemies. No puzzles.
     Just walking through a recovering frozen landscape. Snow crunches underfoot.
     Wind blows. Birds call in the distance. The Shelter grows larger. The player
     reaches the door. It opens. Warmth. Light. End.
- **Companion variations**: If companions accompany the player, they walk alongside
  during the epilogue. Each has unique dialogue—reflections on the train, on the
  world, on what comes next. If only one companion is present, the walk is intimate.
  If multiple companions: they talk to each other, not just the player. If no
  companions: silence, wind, and the player's footsteps. Each version is valid.
- **Failure mode**: If the player's cold suit fails during the walk (didn't prepare
  adequate gear), frostbite progresses. If it reaches lethal: fade to white (not
  black). The journal's final entry appears: "We tried." This is a valid ending—
  tragic but not punitive. The player made the choice to leave. The world wasn't
  quite ready. Or they weren't.
