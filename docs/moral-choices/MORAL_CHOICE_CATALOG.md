# Complete Moral Choice Catalog

> 24 major moral choices across 6 zones (4 per zone). Each entry includes car location, context, options A/B (minimum — most have 3-4 options), and consequences affecting faction rep, companion loyalty, car access, and ending path. No obviously correct answers. Choices compound over time.
>
> **Design principles:** Every choice costs something. Consequences are delayed. The Hidden Ledger tracks five axes: Mercy vs. Pragmatism, Individual vs. Collective, Truth vs. Stability, Force vs. Cunning, Present vs. Future.

## Zone 1: The Tail (Cars 1-15)

### Choice 1: The Ration Dilemma

**Car:** 4 (The Nursery)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Discovery that the Nursery children have been receiving half-rations for a week. Someone is hoarding.

**Context:** Three children are visibly malnourished. Josie reports the shortage. Investigation reveals Old Maggie has been stockpiling rations in Car 2 — not for greed, but because she's calculated that the revolution will require three days of combat rations and the current supply won't last. She is right about the math. The children are suffering now so soldiers can fight later.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Feed the Children** | Redistribute Maggie's stockpile to the Nursery immediately | +10 Mercy, +5 Individual. Children recover. Revolution starts 1 day early (no combat rations — hungrier fighters). Maggie is publicly humiliated and stops contributing to Council logistics. Companion: Edgar +10, Marta +5. Faction: Tail +5. |
| **B: Hold the Line** | Keep Maggie's stockpile for the revolution | +10 Pragmatism, +5 Collective. Children continue to suffer (one may die if untreated — connects to Asha's Triage quest). Revolution is better supplied. Maggie gains influence on Council. Companion: Edgar -10, Samuel +5. Faction: Tail -5 (resentment). |
| **C: Steal from the Jackboots** | Raid the Jackboot supply car (Car 9) for food | +5 Force, +5 Present. High-risk combat encounter. If successful: children fed AND combat rations preserved. If failed: casualties, early Jackboot alert, Grey's boss fight becomes harder. Companion: Edgar +5, Marta +5. Faction: Tail +10 (if successful), -10 (if failed). |
| **D: Share Your Own** | Player gives up their rations for a week | +15 Mercy, +5 Individual. Player operates at reduced stats for 3 in-game days (stamina debuff). Children recover slowly. No political fallout. Quiet choice — NPCs remember this in later zones. Companion: all companions +3 (respect). |

**Compounding:** If children remain unfed, one dies before Car 9. The death is referenced by NPCs for the rest of the game. If the player stole from Jackboots, Grey references the raid during his boss fight: "You're the one who hit my stores. Brave. Stupid. Let's see which matters more."

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary)

### Choice 2: Medicine Allocation

**Car:** 6 (The Sickbay)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Dr. Asha receives three doses of antibiotics (obtained through various means — the source depends on prior quests). Five patients are critical.

**Context:** Five people will die without treatment. Three doses exist. Asha presents the cases:
1. **Tanya's son, age 8** — the Cough, advanced. Will die in days.
2. **Samuel (Council Security)** — infected wound from a Jackboot altercation. Key revolutionary fighter.
3. **An elderly woman, Grandmother Sook-ja** — pneumonia. The Tail's living memory.
4. **A young runner, age 14** — tunnel injury, septic. Nix One's best courier.
5. **A Jackboot prisoner** — captured during a skirmish, wounded. Has intelligence value.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Save the Children** | Treat Tanya's son and the runner | +10 Mercy, +10 Individual. Two children saved. Samuel fights wounded (reduced effectiveness in later combat). Sook-ja may die (lose oral history access). Jackboot prisoner dies (lose intelligence). Companion: Marta +10, Edgar +10, Samuel -5. |
| **B: Save the Fighters** | Treat Samuel and the runner | +10 Pragmatism, +10 Collective. Revolution better prepared. Tanya's son dies (Tanya becomes hostile, emotional weight). Sook-ja may die. Companion: Samuel +10, Edgar -10. Faction: Tail mixed (+5 security-minded, -5 humanitarian). |
| **C: Asha's Recommendation** | Let the doctor triage (requires completing Asha's Triage quest) | +5 Truth. Asha saves Samuel (highest strategic value), the runner (youngest), and the Jackboot prisoner (intelligence). Medical logic, not moral logic. Sook-ja and Tanya's son receive palliative care. Companion: variable (depends on companion medical attitudes). |
| **D: Treat the Enemy** | Include the Jackboot prisoner in the three treated | +15 Mercy, +10 Individual. The prisoner provides intelligence (Jackboot deployment for Cars 9-15). Some Tailies are furious — treating an enemy while their own die. Companion: Father Brennan +15 (if present), Samuel -15. Faction: Tail -10 (immediate), +5 later (when intelligence proves valuable). |

**Compounding:** Survivors appear throughout the game. The Jackboot prisoner, if saved, provides information that makes the Car 9 Blockade significantly easier. Sook-ja's death eliminates the Recitation quest chain. Tanya, if her son dies, becomes a tragic figure who later betrays the revolution in Zone 2 (she sells information to Voss).

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary)

---

### Choice 3: The Kronole Question

**Car:** 12 (Kronole Den)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** The revolution needs to pass through the Kronole Den. Zhora's operation is in the player's path.

**Context:** Kronole is poison. Kronole is also the only thing preventing mass suicide, managing chronic pain, and providing the Tail's most profitable trade commodity. Zhora runs the den with harm-reduction principles, but addiction is rampant. Glass, the Kronole Prophet, claims the visions are sacred. The revolution's leadership is split.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Shut It Down** | Destroy the Kronole lab and supplies | +10 Truth, +10 Future. Kronole no longer available as a healing item. Addicts suffer withdrawal (3 NPCs die over the next zone). Zhora becomes hostile. Glass goes into crisis. Kronole Network trade disrupted (Nix One loses revenue, prices spike in Third Class). Companion: Father Brennan +10, Marta +5, Edgar -5. Faction: Tail +5 (health long-term), -15 (immediate suffering). |
| **B: Keep It Open** | Allow Zhora to continue operating | +10 Stability, +5 Present. Kronole remains available. Addicts stable but still addicted. Zhora grateful, provides medical support for the revolution. Glass continues prophesying. Kronole Network revenue maintained. Companion: Edgar +5, Father Brennan -10. Faction: Tail neutral. |
| **C: Reform** | Work with Zhora to implement strict controls — dosing limits, treatment for the worst cases | +10 Pragmatism, +5 Future. Requires completing Zhora's "Better Formula" quest. Reduced Kronole availability (weaker healing item). Some addicts improve, others resist. Zhora becomes a reluctant medical officer. Companion: Marta +5, Father Brennan +5. Faction: Tail +5. |
| **D: Weaponize** | Convert Kronole production to combat drugs — enhancing fighter performance at the cost of their health | +10 Force, +10 Pragmatism. Kronole-enhanced fighters gain significant combat buffs but suffer long-term health damage (permanent stat reduction after Zone 2). Zhora refuses and must be replaced (or convinced — very high Charisma check). Companion: Samuel +10, all others -5 to -10. Faction: Tail +10 (fighters), -10 (civilians). |

**Compounding:** Zone 3 features Emeka Okonkwo, a Kronole addict. If Kronole was shut down, Emeka is in withdrawal during the trial — harder to get testimony. If weaponized, Kronole-enhanced fighters begin showing symptoms in Zone 3 that mirror the Elevation Program's damage. Zone 6's Ezra uses Kronole — the player's Zone 1 choice affects the supply available for his boss fight.

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Present/Future (secondary)

---

### Choice 4: Gilliam's Secret

**Car:** 14 (Martyr's Gate)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** Discovery of Gilliam's recordings in a hidden compartment behind the memorial wall.

**Context:** The recordings reveal that Gilliam designed the Tail's social structure in collaboration with Wilford. The revolts were staged — pressure valves to prevent total uprising. Gilliam negotiated the protein block system, accepted the sedative, and agreed to periodic child takings as the cost of the Tail's continued existence. He has been managing the Tail's suffering, not fighting it.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Forgive** | Confront Gilliam privately, accept his reasoning | +15 Mercy, +10 Stability. Gilliam remains Council leader. The revolution proceeds with experienced leadership but compromised moral authority. The player carries the secret — a burden that affects dialogue options for the rest of the game. Companion: Father Brennan +10, Samuel -5 (if he finds out later). |
| **B: Condemn** | Confront Gilliam publicly, remove him from leadership | +10 Truth, +10 Force. Gilliam is deposed. The Council fractures — Samuel seizes military command, Martha handles logistics, but there is no unifying leader. The revolution loses strategic guidance but gains moral clarity. Companion: Edgar +10, Samuel +10, Marta -5 (she respected Gilliam). Faction: Tail -10 (chaos) then +15 (galvanized by truth). |
| **C: Keep the Secret** | Say nothing. Burn the recordings | +15 Stability, -10 Truth. Gilliam continues to lead. The revolution has its best chance tactically. The player knows the truth and must live with the silence. If companions discover the player suppressed the truth later (Zone 3 Archive), loyalty penalties are severe. Companion: no immediate change. Faction: no immediate change. *Time bomb.* |
| **D: Tell Everyone** | Broadcast the recordings through the Listening Post (Car 8) | +15 Truth, +5 Force, -10 Stability. The Tail erupts. Gilliam is attacked (he survives but is badly injured). The revolution transforms from an organized movement into a rage-fueled mob. This changes the tone of the entire game — the player is no longer leading a revolution, they are riding a wave. Cars 14-15 become significantly more violent. Companion: variable (all companions react strongly — no neutral responses). Faction: Tail -20 (trust in all authority), +20 (revolutionary fervor). |

**Compounding:** This is the game's first zone-defining choice and its effects ripple through every subsequent zone. Gilliam's fate determines:
- Zone 2: Whether the revolution has strategic leadership (organized advance) or raw momentum (chaotic push)
- Zone 3: The trial with Okonkwo — Gilliam's recordings are admissible evidence if preserved
- Zone 5: Beaumont references the choice — "I heard what you did with your own leader"
- Zone 7: Wilford directly addresses this choice — "You found Gilliam's recordings. Now you understand. Every leader makes the same trade."

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Mercy/Pragmatism (secondary)

## Zone 2: Third Class (Cars 16-30)

### Choice 5: The Strike

**Car:** 22 (Industrial Car)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** A worker dies in an industrial accident. Petra Kovic calls for a general strike.

**Context:** The worker died because a safety guard was removed to increase production speed — on Jackboot orders. Ivan Borodin (foreman) knew about the risk but couldn't stop it. Petra's Union wants a strike. The Jackboots will retaliate. Third Class families are caught in the middle.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Support the Strike** | Stand with the Union, help organize the walkout | +10 Force, +10 Collective. Production halts. Jackboots mobilize — potential for violence (combat encounter in Car 22). If the strike holds, working conditions improve permanently (safety guards restored, shift length reduced). Jackboot rations are cut as punishment. Companion: Big Andrei +10 (solidarity), Yuki +5 (worker sympathy). Faction: Third Class +20, Jackboots -15. |
| **B: Negotiate** | Broker a deal between Petra and the Jackboot foreman | +10 Cunning, +5 Stability. No violence. Safety guards partially restored. Shift length unchanged. The Jackboot foreman (Sergeant Kov) becomes a reluctant contact — not an ally, but someone who will take the player's calls. Companion: Nadia +10 (diplomacy), Big Andrei -5 (disappointed). Faction: Third Class +5, Jackboots neutral. |
| **C: Sabotage** | Destroy the dangerous equipment, making the safety question moot | +10 Cunning, +5 Force. Equipment destroyed — production drops permanently (affects train-wide supply chain). No one is hurt, but the Jackboots investigate. Ivan takes the blame unless the player intervenes. If Ivan is blamed, he is sent to the brig (connect to Brass's location in Zone 4). Companion: Yuki +10 (engineering appreciation), Wrench +5. Faction: Third Class +10, Jackboots -10. |
| **D: Exploit the Crisis** | Use the worker's death as propaganda — spread the story to Second Class to build cross-class solidarity | +10 Cunning, +10 Future. No immediate resolution to the safety issue. But the story reaches Second Class, where it generates sympathy. This creates the foundation for the cross-class alliance in Zone 3. The dead worker becomes a symbol — their name is graffitied on walls in Cars 22-30. Companion: Edgar +10 (storytelling), Nadia +5. Faction: Third Class +5, Second Class +5 (later). |

**Compounding:** The strike outcome affects the Dietrich boss encounter. A successful strike means the workers support the player — Dietrich's defense force is smaller. A negotiated peace means Dietrich respects the player's restraint — her non-combat resolution is easier. Sabotage makes Dietrich wary — she fights harder because she's seen what the player is willing to destroy.

**Ledger Impact:** Force/Cunning (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary)

---

### Choice 6: The Informant's Family

**Car:** 19 (Third Class Market)
**Tier:** 2 (Encounter)
**Trigger:** Cora "Switchblade" Mendez's quest reveals the informant's identity.

**Context:** The Jackboot informant in Cora's network is a parent named Belen. Her child is being held in the Jackboot barracks (Car 26) as leverage — "inform or your daughter goes to the front." Belen has been feeding patrol routes to the Jackboots for six months, compromising the Kronole Network and endangering the revolution.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Expose Belen** | Reveal the informant to Cora's network | +5 Pragmatism, +5 Collective. Belen is expelled from the market. Her daughter remains captive. The network is secured but a family is destroyed. Cora's operations resume safely. Companion: Nadia +5 (security), Father Brennan -10 (compassion). Faction: Kronole Network +10. |
| **B: Rescue the Child** | Raid the Jackboot barracks to free Belen's daughter | +10 Mercy, +10 Force. Combat encounter in Car 26. If successful, Belen stops informing, the family is reunited, and Cora's network is preserved. The raid alerts the Jackboots to the player's presence in Third Class — increased patrols in Cars 23-30. Companion: Marta +10, Edgar +5. Faction: Third Class +10, Jackboots -15. |
| **C: Turn Belen** | Convince Belen to become a double agent — feed false information to the Jackboots | +10 Cunning, +5 Future. High-risk strategy. Belen agrees (her daughter is still captive, but the false intel protects the network while maintaining her cover). If it works: strategic advantage in Cars 23-30. If the Jackboots discover the deception: Belen and her daughter are both killed. Companion: Nadia +15 (espionage), Colonel Harker +5 (tactical). |
| **D: Negotiate with the Jackboot** | Find the Jackboot holding Belen's daughter and negotiate the child's release | +10 Cunning, +5 Mercy. Requires finding the specific Jackboot (Corporal Dex, Car 26) and making a deal. Dex wants something: a Kronole supply for personal use (he's a secret user). Trading Kronole for the child resolves the situation without violence but creates a Jackboot with a secret — and a dependency. Companion: mixed. Faction: complex. |

**Compounding:** If Belen's daughter is rescued, the family appears in Zone 3 — Belen testifies at Okonkwo's trial about Jackboot coercion. If Belen was exposed, she appears in Zone 3 as a hostile witness for the prosecution. If turned double agent, the intelligence she provides makes Zone 2's final stretch significantly easier — but if it fails, the failure is referenced throughout Zone 3 as evidence of revolutionary recklessness.

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Force/Cunning (secondary)

### Choice 7: The Chapel Divide

**Car:** 23 (Chapel of the Engine)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Brother Kessler's crisis — Ezra orders him to preach eugenics doctrine.

**Context:** The Order of the Engine has two faces in Third Class: Kessler's gentle community chapel and Ezra's increasingly radical central doctrine. Ezra wants ideological uniformity. Kessler wants to protect his congregation. The player is caught between supporting Kessler's quiet resistance (which protects the community but doesn't challenge the Order) or pushing for an open break (which challenges the Order but endangers Kessler's people).

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Support Kessler's Quiet Resistance** | Help Kessler draft a counter-sermon that technically follows doctrine while subverting its message | +10 Cunning, +10 Stability. The chapel continues operating as a community center. Ezra's hardliners are satisfied by the surface compliance. Kessler's people are protected. But the eugenics doctrine spreads unchallenged in other chapels. Companion: Father Brennan +15, Nadia +5. Faction: Order neutral. |
| **B: Force an Open Break** | Encourage Kessler to publicly defy Ezra | +10 Truth, +10 Force. Kessler delivers an anti-eugenics sermon that splits the Third Class Order congregation. Half follow Kessler (reform faction), half report to Ezra (hardliners). Kessler is expelled from the Order but his chapel becomes a resistance headquarters. Ezra sends agents to investigate. Companion: Father Brennan +10, Edgar +10. Faction: Order -15, resistance +10. |
| **C: Infiltrate the Order** | Use Kessler's position to plant agents inside the Order's communications network | +15 Cunning, +5 Future. Kessler performs the sermon as ordered (it disgusts him) but gains access to Order communications. The player receives intelligence about Sanctum operations, Ezra's mental state, and Order troop movements. The moral cost: Kessler's congregation hears eugenics doctrine and some internalize it. Companion: Nadia +15, Father Brennan -10 (compromise). Faction: Order +5 (trust), covert advantage. |
| **D: Destroy the Chapel** | Burn the chapel down, eliminating the Order's Third Class presence entirely | +10 Force, -10 Stability. The chapel is destroyed. Kessler is devastated. Order presence in Third Class eliminated — but so is the community center. Third Class families who relied on the chapel for meals, counseling, and childcare are displaced. Companion: all companions -5 (excessive), Samuel +5 (strategic). Faction: Order -20, Third Class -10 (community loss). |

**Compounding:** The Third Class Order faction's state directly affects the Zone 6 Ezra encounter. A reformed Order (Kessler's faction) provides allies who can turn Acolytes during the Gauntlet fight. An infiltrated Order provides intelligence that reveals Ezra's weaknesses. A destroyed chapel means Ezra references the destruction in his sermon: "They burn what they don't understand. This is why the Engine chose us to endure."

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Force/Cunning (secondary)

### Choice 8: The Checkpoint Decision

**Car:** 30 (The Checkpoint — Dietrich Boss Encounter)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** The player reaches Dietrich's Checkpoint at the Zone 2/3 border.

**Context:** Dietrich guards the border between Third Class and Second Class. She is not the player's enemy — she is the protector of 620 workers who will be caught between Tail rage and Jackboot response if the revolution passes through. Her terms are clear: protect Third Class or fight through it.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Accept Dietrich's Terms** | Promise no looting, volunteers only, ration systems intact | +10 Mercy, +10 Stability. Peaceful passage. Third Class is preserved. The revolution loses potential fighters (only volunteers, not conscripts). Dietrich becomes a neutral party who may assist later (she provides supply lines through Zone 3). Companion: Big Andrei +15 (he's Third Class), Marta +5. Faction: Third Class +25, revolution strength -10%. |
| **B: Fight Through** | Reject negotiations, force the Checkpoint | +10 Force, -10 Mercy. Multi-phase combat encounter against Dietrich and her Third Class security volunteers. Collateral damage to Third Class infrastructure. Workers are terrified — some flee, some fight against the player. Dietrich fights to protect her people. If killed, Third Class has no administrator — chaos follows. Companion: Big Andrei -20 (his people), Samuel +10. Faction: Third Class -30, Jackboots -5 (alarmed). |
| **C: The Karl Dietrich Memorial** | Present evidence of Karl Dietrich's memorial name from Car 14 | +15 Mercy, +5 Truth. Dietrich breaks emotionally. She opens the gate. She does not join the revolution — she goes to the memorial wall. This resolution leaves Third Class leaderless temporarily but without violence. Workers are confused but unharmed. Companion: all companions +5 (respect for non-violence). Faction: Third Class +10, emotional weight. |
| **D: The Workers' Revolution** | Convince Dietrich that the Tail's revolution IS Third Class's revolution — unite the movements | +10 Collective, +10 Future. Requires Union alliance from Petra's quest AND evidence of shared oppression (worker death records, Jackboot abuse documentation). If successful, Dietrich joins the revolution with her entire security force — the largest military gain in the game. The revolution doubles in size. But Dietrich demands equal representation in post-revolution governance. Companion: Big Andrei +20, Petra (NPC) becomes available. Faction: Third Class +30, revolution structure fundamentally changed. |

**Compounding:** This choice restructures the revolution's character for the remainder of the game. A mercy-based passage creates a narrow, focused revolution. A violent passage creates a feared revolution. The Karl memorial creates a haunted revolution. The workers' alliance creates a broad-based movement that is stronger but harder to control. Each path changes NPC dialogue, faction reactions, and available options for the next four zones.

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary), Force/Cunning (tertiary)

## Zone 3: Second Class (Cars 31-48)

### Choice 9: The Trial

**Car:** 48 (Judicial Chamber — Okonkwo Boss Encounter)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** The player reaches Magistrate Okonkwo's court.

**Context:** Okonkwo offers the player a trial — a genuine legal proceeding where the player can present evidence, call witnesses, and argue for the revolution's legitimacy under Okonkwo's own legal framework. This is the game's most complex social encounter.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Win the Trial** | Present evidence of Wilford's crimes, turn the jury | +15 Truth, +10 Cunning. Requires collected evidence: Archive records, Elevation Program files, census discrepancy data, worker death documentation. Okonkwo accepts the verdict. Second Class citizens acknowledge the revolution's legitimacy. Some join voluntarily. Companion: Nadia +15 (justice), Father Brennan +10. Faction: Second Class +25. |
| **B: Lose the Trial, Win the People** | Deliberately lose the trial but use the courtroom as a stage — deliver a speech that moves the jury emotionally even if the legal argument fails | +10 Force, +10 Truth. The player is convicted but the jury is divided. Okonkwo sentences the player to the Drawers — but sympathetic Second Class citizens break them out (requires prior alliance-building in Zone 3). The rescue becomes a rallying point. Companion: Edgar +15 (storytelling), Nadia -5 (reckless). Faction: Second Class +10 (populist), -10 (establishment). |
| **C: Use Emeka** | Bring Okonkwo's son Emeka to testify about the Elevation Program's true purpose | +10 Truth, +10 Mercy. Emeka's testimony is legally damaging AND personally devastating. Okonkwo is forced to choose between her legal principles and her son. She does not collapse — she recuses herself. Without a judge, the trial dissolves. The player passes, but the legal system Okonkwo built is damaged. Companion: Father Brennan +10, Nadia +5. Faction: Second Class +5 (sympathy), -5 (institutions damaged). |
| **D: Bypass the Court** | Refuse the trial, fight through the Bailiffs | +10 Force, -15 Truth. "This is what law was supposed to prevent." Okonkwo watches the player destroy her court. Second Class citizens see the revolution as violent and lawless. The passage is secured but the moral ground is lost. Companion: Samuel +5, all others -5 to -10. Faction: Second Class -20, Jackboots -5 (alarmed). |

**Compounding:** The trial's outcome defines how Second Class relates to the revolution for the rest of the game. A legal victory means Second Class citizens actively assist in Zones 4-5. A populist victory means underground support but institutional resistance. Emeka's testimony creates a personal debt — Okonkwo seeks the player out in Zone 5 for a private conversation. A violent passage means Second Class NPCs flee or resist throughout the remaining zones.

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Force/Cunning (secondary)

### Choice 10: The Surveillance Dilemma

**Car:** 44 (Surveillance Hub)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** The player gains access to the train's surveillance system through Whisper's quest.

**Context:** The Surveillance Hub monitors every car on the train. The player can use it, destroy it, or subvert it. Each option has profound implications for the revolution and for the train's future governance.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Use It** | Take control of the surveillance system, redirecting it to serve the revolution | +10 Cunning, +10 Pragmatism. The player gains real-time intelligence on Jackboot movements, Wilford's communications, and civilian activity. This provides massive tactical advantage for Zones 4-6. But the revolution now operates a surveillance state — the same tool that oppressed the Tail. Companion: Nadia +15, Colonel Harker +10, Father Brennan -15. Faction: revolution efficiency +25%, moral authority -15%. |
| **B: Destroy It** | Smash the surveillance system. No one watches anyone | +15 Truth, +10 Force. The train goes blind. No surveillance of anyone by anyone. This creates chaos — but also freedom. Crime increases in Second and Third Class (petty theft, score-settling). But organized oppression becomes impossible. Companion: Edgar +10 (freedom), Nadia -10 (lost tool), Father Brennan +10. Faction: all factions neutral (nobody benefits). |
| **C: Expose It** | Broadcast the surveillance feeds to every car on the train simultaneously — let everyone see everyone | +15 Truth, +5 Collective. Total transparency. Every secret on the train is revealed at once. This causes an immediate social earthquake — affairs exposed, corruption visible, Wilford's private quarters shown to the masses. The effects are unpredictable and widespread. Companion: Edgar +15 (radical truth), all others varied. Faction: all factions disrupted. |
| **D: Selective Use** | Use the system only for intelligence on Wilford and the Sanctum, disable surveillance of civilians | +10 Cunning, +10 Mercy. A compromise that Whisper proposes — surgical intelligence gathering. The player gains Wilford-specific intelligence without becoming a surveillance state. But Whisper maintains access and may use it for their own purposes. Companion: Nadia +10, Father Brennan +5. Faction: moderate benefit. |

**Compounding:** If the player uses the surveillance system, Wilford references it in the final encounter: "You found my eyes and ears. And then you used them. How did it feel?" If destroyed, the Sanctum's internal monitoring is also offline — Ezra can't track the player in Zone 6. If broadcast, every NPC in the game reacts to specific revelations — massive dialogue tree changes.

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Force/Cunning (secondary)

---

### Choice 11: The Archive Decision

**Car:** 39 (The Archive)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Konstantin Volkov offers the player access to the complete historical record.

**Context:** The Archive contains everything: proof of every crime, every kindness, every lie, every truth on the train. It is also the only copy. If the revolution turns violent, the Archive may be destroyed — and with it, the record of what happened.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Copy Everything** | Transcribe critical records for distribution | +10 Truth, +5 Future. Time-consuming (player spends in-game time in the Archive, missing other Zone 3 opportunities). Ensures records survive regardless of what happens to the Archive. Distributed copies become evidence in multiple quest chains. Companion: Edgar +10 (knowledge preservation), Nadia +5. |
| **B: Take What You Need** | Extract only evidence useful for the revolution | +10 Pragmatism, +5 Cunning. Quick, efficient. Player gets trial evidence, Elevation Program records, and Wilford communications. But the broader historical record remains vulnerable. Konstantin is disappointed — "You came for ammunition, not truth." Companion: Nadia +10, Edgar -5. |
| **C: Protect the Archive** | Ask Konstantin to seal the Archive against destruction — whatever happens, the records survive | +15 Stability, +5 Future. Konstantin seals the restricted section with physical and procedural locks. The records are preserved but inaccessible during the revolution — no evidence for the trial, no intelligence for Zone 4+. Companion: Edgar +15 (preservation), Nadia -10 (lost intelligence). Faction: historical truth protected. |
| **D: Burn It** | Destroy the Archive — erase the past so the future isn't bound by it | +10 Force, -15 Truth. Konstantin attempts to stop the player (non-lethal encounter). The Archive burns. All historical evidence is lost. The revolution loses its intellectual foundation but gains freedom from the past. Wilford can no longer use the records against anyone — but neither can the revolution prove its claims. Companion: Edgar -20 (unforgivable), all others -5 to -10. Faction: universal loss. |

**Compounding:** The Archive's fate is referenced in every subsequent zone. If preserved, evidence is available for multiple endgame paths. If burned, Wilford says: "You burned the only record of what I did. Now it's your word against mine. History belongs to whoever survives longest."

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Present/Future (secondary)

---

### Choice 12: The Elevation Program

**Car:** 42 (The Voting Car)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Discovery of the full Elevation Program records — children taken from the Tail and Third Class, raised as operatives.

**Context:** The records reveal twelve children were taken and raised in the Elevation Program. Three committed suicide. Two are in the Drawers. Five are functioning operatives in various positions. One is Melena Voss. One is unaccounted for. The program was designed by Wilford to create loyal agents with Tail knowledge.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Expose the Program** | Broadcast the records to Second Class — let everyone know what was done to children | +15 Truth, +10 Force. Second Class citizens are horrified. Support for the revolution spikes. The five functioning operatives are identified and face social consequences — some flee, some are attacked. Voss's cover is blown (she becomes more dangerous, operating openly). Companion: Edgar +10, Marta +15 (personal — she knew some of the children). Faction: Second Class +15, Jackboots -10. |
| **B: Approach the Operatives** | Contact the five functioning operatives individually, offering them a choice — continue serving Wilford or join the revolution | +10 Mercy, +10 Cunning. Requires time and social skill. Two operatives defect (providing intelligence). Two refuse (and report to Voss). One commits suicide (the guilt of what they've done, compounded by the revelation of what they were). Companion: Father Brennan +5 (compassion), Nadia +10 (spy recruitment). Faction: intelligence gain, moral weight. |
| **C: Confront Voss** | Use the records directly in the Zone 3 confrontation with Voss | +10 Truth, +5 Force. Save the evidence for the Voss encounter in Car 42. The confrontation is more powerful with full documentation. Voss's reaction is visceral — she knew about the program intellectually, but seeing her own file breaks something. Companion: variable (depends on Voss resolution). |
| **D: Bury It** | Hide the records — too many lives are entangled, too much damage would result from exposure | +10 Stability, +5 Mercy. The operatives continue their lives undisturbed. Voss's identity remains hidden from the public. But the player knows, and the knowledge sits like poison. Companions who learn the player suppressed this information react strongly. Companion: Father Brennan -10 (truth suppression), Nadia -5. |

**Compounding:** The Elevation Program revelation connects to Zone 4's child labor discovery and Zone 6's eugenics program. A player who has exposed the Elevation Program has established a pattern — each subsequent revelation of Wilford's child exploitation hits harder because the audience already believes. A player who buried it faces the question again and again: when is truth worth the cost?

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Mercy/Pragmatism (secondary)

## Zone 4: Working Spine (Cars 49-62)

### Choice 13: The Engine's Children

**Car:** 56 (Cold Lab) / Car 58 (access panels)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** Definitive discovery of the child labor program inside the Engine.

**Context:** The player discovers, through Sasha's quest and Cold Lab records, that children have been used as Engine maintenance workers for fifteen years. Twelve are currently active. The Engine cannot function without them — adult hands cannot reach the critical components. Kazakov designed the access panels. Wilford authorized the program. The children are not enslaved in a traditional sense — they are well-fed, housed, and educated. But they are children working inside a machine, and they were taken from their families.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Immediate Rescue** | Extract the children from the Engine now, consequences be damned | +15 Mercy, +10 Individual, -10 Pragmatism. The children are freed. The Engine begins degrading — without maintenance, critical systems will fail within weeks. Kazakov is devastated (he designed the system, knowing this dependency). The entire train is now on a timer. Companion: Marta +20 (personal — her sister's child may be among them), Yuki -5 (engineering concern). Faction: universal moral approval, universal practical panic. |
| **B: Transition Plan** | Work with Kazakov to design adult-accessible modifications, then extract the children | +10 Pragmatism, +10 Future. Kazakov agrees — he has wanted to fix this for years. The transition takes time (in-game, this manifests as a quest chain through Zone 5). Children remain working during the transition but with improved conditions. Companion: Yuki +15 (engineering solution), Marta +5 (progress), Colonel Harker +10 (military planning). Faction: moderate approval, practical hope. |
| **C: Expose Without Acting** | Document the program and broadcast evidence to the train, but do not extract the children yet | +15 Truth, -5 Pragmatism. The train learns the truth. Public opinion turns decisively against Wilford. But the children are still in the Engine — and now everyone knows, which means Wilford may increase security around them. The moral pressure builds toward an endgame resolution. Companion: Edgar +15, Nadia +10, Marta -5 (not enough). Faction: massive public opinion shift. |
| **D: Use the Knowledge** | Keep the discovery secret and use it as leverage against Wilford in the final encounter | +10 Cunning, -10 Truth. The player calculates that the information is more powerful as a weapon than as a liberation. In the final encounter with Wilford, revealing the child labor program in his own chamber — with his own Engine behind him — is the most devastating possible argument. But it means leaving the children working for the duration of the game. Companion: Nadia +5 (strategic), all others -10 to -15 (delayed justice). Faction: no change (secret held). |

**Compounding:** This is the game's emotional fulcrum. Every ending path is affected:
- **Immediate rescue** → Engine timer creates urgency for the Exodus ending (the train can't last)
- **Transition plan** → Engine modification becomes the mechanical basis for the Revolution ending (the system can change)
- **Exposure** → Public knowledge drives the Eternal Loop ending (truth without action)
- **Leverage** → Weaponized truth shapes the New Wilford ending (power through information control)

The children's fate is the most-referenced consequence in Wilford's final conversation.

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Truth/Stability (secondary), Present/Future (tertiary)

---

### Choice 14: Kazakov's Bargain

**Car:** 62 (The Drawbridge)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Kazakov's boss encounter — the non-combat resolution path.

**Context:** Kazakov offers a deal: if the player promises to preserve the train's infrastructure, he will allow passage. The test requires demonstrating engineering knowledge and a track record of preservation over destruction.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Accept the Bargain** | Promise to preserve infrastructure. Pass Kazakov's test | +10 Stability, +10 Future. Kazakov opens the bridge. He becomes a non-combat companion for Zones 5-6, providing technical solutions. But the promise constrains the player — destroying infrastructure in later zones causes Kazakov to abandon them. Companion: Yuki +15, Wrench +10. Faction: Working Spine +20. |
| **B: Confront with Truth** | Show Kazakov the child labor evidence — force him to face what his designs enabled | +15 Truth, -5 Stability. Kazakov collapses. He doesn't fight. He opens the bridge and sits down: "I designed the access panels they crawl through." He does not become a companion — he is broken. But the bridge is open and the moral victory is complete. Companion: Marta +15, Father Brennan +10. |
| **C: Fight Him** | Reject the bargain, defeat Kazakov in his environmental arena | +10 Force. Combat encounter against Kazakov's bridge mechanisms. The player must avoid environmental traps while closing distance. Kazakov fights with his wrench and exo-frame. Defeating him damages the bridge mechanism (repairable but time-consuming). Companion: Colonel Harker +5. Faction: Working Spine -15. |
| **D: Recruit as Ally** | Offer Kazakov a role in the post-revolution train — Chief Engineer, answering to the people instead of Wilford | +10 Cunning, +10 Future. Kazakov is tempted. He has always wanted to maintain the train without Wilford's compromises. If the player has a track record of preservation (low infrastructure destruction score), Kazakov accepts. He becomes the most valuable technical ally in the game. Companion: Yuki +20 (she idolizes him), Wrench +15. Faction: Working Spine +25. |

**Compounding:** Kazakov's fate determines the player's technical capability for the rest of the game. As an ally, he provides solutions to problems in Zones 5-6 that otherwise require combat. As a broken man, he provides nothing but guilt. As a defeated enemy, the Working Spine remembers — and maintenance crews become hostile in Zone 5.

**Ledger Impact:** Force/Cunning (primary), Truth/Stability (secondary)

---

### Choice 15: The Population Data

**Car:** 56 (Cold Lab)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Dr. Maren Holst shows the player Wilford's population projections.

**Context:** The math is clear: the current population (2,800) is unsustainable. Within 30 years, extinction. Wilford's solution: managed reduction to 1,500 through "natural" attrition (letting the Tail and most of Third Class die). The alternative: finding a way to increase resources (the Thaw) or reduce population more equitably. There is no comfortable answer.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Reject the Math** | Refuse to accept Wilford's framework — the revolution will find another way | +10 Individual, +5 Mercy. Inspirational but unscientific. The population problem doesn't go away because the player rejects it. Maren is frustrated: "Hope is not a survival strategy." But the refusal maintains moral authority and motivates the search for alternatives (Thaw evidence, genetic data). Companion: Edgar +10 (hope), Yuki -5 (engineering realism). |
| **B: Accept the Numbers** | Acknowledge the population crisis and begin planning equitable reduction | +10 Pragmatism, +10 Collective. The player engages with the hardest question: if reduction is necessary, how do you do it ethically? This unlocks a quest chain in Zone 5 where the player works with Dr. Sorensen on contraception programs, resource optimization, and voluntary population management. The conversation is uncomfortable. Companion: Yuki +10, Marta -10 (she won't plan people's elimination). |
| **C: Bet on the Thaw** | Use the temperature data to argue that the outside world is becoming viable — population reduction is unnecessary if the train isn't the only option | +10 Future, +10 Truth. Requires Thaw evidence from Ironside and Rosa's quests. Maren is cautiously hopeful: the data supports the hypothesis, but it's uncertain. This path commits the player toward the Exodus ending. Companion: Kira Frost +15 (her entire existence validates this), all others variable. |
| **D: Suppress the Data** | Prevent anyone from seeing Wilford's projections — the knowledge is too dangerous | +10 Stability, -10 Truth. The population data is hidden. The revolution proceeds without confronting its most fundamental challenge. Maren is appalled: "You're doing what Wilford did — deciding what people can know." But the morale benefits are real: troops fight harder when they don't know the math. Companion: Nadia +5 (strategic), Edgar -15 (suppression). |

**Compounding:** The population data directly frames the endgame choice. A player who rejected the math must confront it again with Wilford. A player who accepted it arrives at the Engine with a plan. A player who bet on the Thaw has staked everything on uncertain science. A player who suppressed it is asked by Wilford: "You found my numbers. And you hid them. Just like I did."

**Ledger Impact:** Present/Future (primary), Truth/Stability (secondary)

---

### Choice 16: The Saboteur's Fate

**Car:** 57 (Maintenance Tunnel)
**Tier:** 2 (Encounter)
**Trigger:** Gears' quest reveals the infrastructure saboteur.

**Context:** The saboteur, a Thaw Believer mechanic named Ren, has been deliberately damaging the train's systems to force a breakdown in a warming zone. His logic: if the train stops in a region where external temperatures are survivable, people can walk away. His risk calculation: if he's wrong about the temperatures, everyone dies.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Stop Ren** | Arrest or restrain the saboteur, prevent further damage | +10 Stability, +5 Pragmatism. The train's infrastructure is protected. Ren is imprisoned (joins Brass in the brig). The Thaw Believer cell is demoralized. But the train keeps running — which means the status quo continues. Companion: Yuki +10 (safety), Kira -5 (she sympathizes with Ren). |
| **B: Help Ren** | Assist the saboteur in creating a controlled stop at the next warming zone | +10 Force, +15 Future. Extremely high risk. The player and Ren work together to sabotage the train's propulsion in a way that creates a safe stop (requires Engineering skill). If successful: the train stops in a warming zone, and the player can test exterior conditions. If failed: catastrophic mechanical failure, NPC deaths. Companion: Kira +20, Yuki -15 (reckless). |
| **C: Redirect Ren** | Convince the saboteur to stop damaging the train and instead help prepare for a controlled exit — preservation, not destruction | +10 Cunning, +10 Future. Ren's skills are valuable. He becomes a Thaw Believer asset: instead of sabotage, he prepares emergency shelters, cold suits, and exterior equipment for an eventual planned exit. The damage stops. The preparation begins. Companion: Kira +15, Yuki +10 (constructive engineering). |
| **D: Execute Ren** | Kill the saboteur to prevent any possibility of catastrophic damage | +10 Pragmatism, -10 Mercy. Ren is dead. The threat is eliminated permanently. But the Thaw Believers go underground — they view the player as an enemy. This blocks the Exodus ending path unless the player regains Thaw Believer trust through extraordinary measures. Companion: Colonel Harker +5 (military logic), all others -5 to -10. |

**Compounding:** Ren's fate connects to the Exodus ending. A redirected Ren provides the technical expertise for a controlled train exit. A helped Ren may have created the conditions for a forced exit. An executed Ren means the Thaw Believers work against the player in Zone 6.

**Ledger Impact:** Present/Future (primary), Mercy/Pragmatism (secondary)

## Zone 5: First Class (Cars 63-82)

### Choice 17: The Dinner with Beaumont

**Car:** 82 (The Penthouse)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** Beaumont's boss encounter — the dinner invitation.

**Context:** Beaumont invites the player to sit at her table. She knows the revolution is coming. She is offering a deal: preserve First Class in exchange for her cooperation. She is also offering something more dangerous — legitimacy. If the player dines with Beaumont and negotiates a settlement, the revolution transforms from uprising into political transition. If they refuse, it remains a war.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Accept the Deal** | Dine with Beaumont, agree to preserve First Class autonomy | +10 Cunning, +10 Stability. Peaceful passage to the Sanctum. Beaumont becomes a political ally — powerful, experienced, and fundamentally committed to inequality. She will undermine democratic reforms in the epilogue. First Class is preserved intact, including its luxury, its inequality, and its complicity. Companion: Vivienne -10 (she knows her aunt), Nadia +10 (political acumen). Faction: First Class +25, Tail -15 (betrayal). |
| **B: Reject and Fight** | Refuse the dinner, trigger Beaumont's defenses | +10 Force, +10 Truth. Multi-phase combat through the Penthouse's trapped rooms. Beaumont's security team fights with real firearms (the hardest combat in Zone 5). If the player wins, Beaumont is captured and First Class power structure collapses. Companion: Colonel Harker +10 (military), Vivienne +5 (freedom from family). Faction: First Class -20, revolution +15 (decisive action). |
| **C: Expose and Dismantle** | Use collected evidence to destroy Beaumont's social network before confronting her | +15 Cunning, +10 Truth. Requires blackmail records, financial documents, and recorded conversations from throughout Zone 5. Broadcasting these destroys Beaumont's power base. Her security team abandons her. She is left alone in the Penthouse: "Well played." The revolution claims First Class without major violence — but through manipulation, not justice. Companion: Nadia +15, Father Brennan -5 (manipulation). |
| **D: The Mercy Path** | Appeal to Beaumont's humanity — show that the revolution is different from what she fears | +15 Mercy, +5 Truth. Requires a consistent mercy record across the entire game (tracked by Ledger). Beaumont recognizes genuine restraint: "You didn't burn your way here." She steps aside voluntarily. This is the hardest resolution to achieve (requires specific Ledger scores across multiple axes) but the most narratively satisfying — Beaumont is neither defeated nor co-opted but convinced. Companion: all companions +5 (respect). Faction: First Class +15, universal respect. |

**Compounding:** Beaumont's fate determines First Class's role in the endgame. An allied Beaumont subverts the revolution from within. A defeated Beaumont leaves a power vacuum. An exposed Beaumont creates transparency. A convinced Beaumont becomes a genuine reformer — the rarest outcome. Wilford references every path: "Genevieve told me what you did. / Genevieve warned me about you. / Genevieve is silent, which worries me more."

**Ledger Impact:** All five axes are relevant. This is the game's most Ledger-dependent choice.

---

### Choice 18: The Last Dose

**Car:** 66 (First Class Medical Suite)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Dr. Ingrid Sorensen's quest — a First Class patient and a Third Class patient both need the same medicine.

**Context:** The last dose of a critical cardiac medication exists. Two patients need it: a First Class elder (Lord Pemberton, 78, a kind man who donated his personal food surplus to Third Class children during a famine in Year 9) and a Third Class worker (Mrs. Kozlov — Ivan Borodin's organizer's wife from Zone 2, who has been helping the revolution). Only one dose. The medicine cannot be synthesized.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Save the Worker** | Give the dose to Mrs. Kozlov | +5 Collective, +5 Pragmatism. Mrs. Kozlov survives, continues supporting the revolution. Lord Pemberton dies — his death ripples through First Class (he was beloved even by those who disagreed with his charity). First Class citizens who knew him become hostile. Companion: Big Andrei +5 (class solidarity), Vivienne -10 (she knew Pemberton). Faction: Third Class +5, First Class -10. |
| **B: Save the Elder** | Give the dose to Lord Pemberton | +5 Individual, +5 Mercy. Lord Pemberton survives and becomes a First Class ally — his moral authority legitimizes the revolution among the wealthy. Mrs. Kozlov dies — Ivan is devastated. The revolution loses an organizer. Companion: Vivienne +10, Big Andrei -10 (class betrayal). Faction: First Class +10, Third Class -10. |
| **C: Let the Doctor Decide** | Defer to Dr. Sorensen's medical judgment | +5 Stability. Sorensen applies triage protocols: she chooses the patient most likely to recover fully. This is Mrs. Kozlov (younger, stronger). The decision is medical, not political — but it feels political. Lord Pemberton's family accuses Sorensen of bias. Companion: Marta +5 (medical ethics), variable others. |
| **D: Refuse to Choose** | Walk away from the decision entirely | +5 Individual, -5 Collective. The player refuses the role of arbiter. Sorensen makes the choice herself (she saves Mrs. Kozlov — younger patient). But the player's refusal is noted: "You won't make the hard calls. Someone has to." This dialogue is echoed by Wilford in the final encounter. |

**Compounding:** Whichever patient dies, their death echoes. Lord Pemberton's death makes First Class hostile; his survival makes them receptive. Mrs. Kozlov's death enrages Ivan; her survival strengthens the worker alliance. The choice is mirrored by Wilford: "Who lives and who dies. That's the only question on this train. I've been answering it for seventeen years. How does it feel to answer it once?"

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary)

---

### Choice 19: The Drawers

**Car:** 66 (First Class Medical Suite — lower level)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Dr. Sorensen reveals the thirty-seven people in cryogenic suspension.

**Context:** Thirty-seven people are frozen in the Drawers. Some are political prisoners (dissidents from previous revolts). Some are criminals. Some are people Wilford wanted silenced. One is a pre-freeze climate scientist who predicted the Thaw ten years ago and was frozen for "spreading dangerous misinformation." The player can free some or all — but each awakening requires medical resources and recovery time.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Free Everyone** | Wake all thirty-seven prisoners | +15 Mercy, +10 Individual. Massive resource drain (medical supplies, food, space). Many prisoners are disoriented, traumatized, or physically damaged. Some are dangerous (one is a serial killer frozen in Year 4). But among them are valuable allies — the climate scientist, former military officers, a pre-freeze engineer. The chaos is real but so is the moral statement: nobody stays frozen. Companion: Father Brennan +15, Marta +10. Faction: variable (depends on who wakes up). |
| **B: Free Selectively** | Wake only those who are politically useful — the climate scientist, military officers, anyone who can help | +10 Pragmatism, +5 Cunning. Strategic awakenings. The climate scientist provides Thaw data. The military officers provide tactical advice. But the player is choosing who deserves freedom based on utility — exactly what Wilford did when he froze them. Companion: Nadia +10 (strategic), Father Brennan -10 (selective mercy). |
| **C: Free the Climate Scientist Only** | Wake one person — Dr. Yara Nasser, the scientist who predicted the Thaw | +5 Future, +5 Truth. Dr. Nasser provides the most critical piece of the Exodus puzzle: hard scientific evidence that external temperatures will reach survivable levels within 2-3 years. Her data transforms the Thaw from hypothesis to near-certainty. But thirty-six people remain frozen. Companion: Kira +15, others variable. |
| **D: Leave Them Frozen** | Do not open the Drawers — the risk and resource cost are too high | +5 Pragmatism, -10 Mercy. The prisoners remain. The player gains nothing and loses nothing. But the knowledge that they chose not to free people is carried forward. Wilford knows about the Drawers — if the player didn't open them, he says: "You walked past thirty-seven frozen people and kept walking. We're more alike than you think." |

**Compounding:** The Drawers prisoners affect multiple endings. The climate scientist is the key evidence for the Exodus ending. The military officers provide options for the Revolution ending's governance structure. The serial killer, if freed, causes an incident in Zone 6 that the player must resolve. Wilford references the Drawers in every ending path.

**Ledger Impact:** Mercy/Pragmatism (primary), Individual/Collective (secondary)

---

### Choice 20: The Painting

**Car:** 75 (Private Gallery)
**Tier:** 2 (Encounter)
**Trigger:** Lord Ashworth's quest — the stolen Rothko.

**Context:** A small choice with outsized symbolic weight. A Third Class servant stole a Rothko painting from Lord Ashworth's gallery. The painting is worth nothing in practical terms (you can't eat art). But it represents everything the class system protects: beauty reserved for the few, hoarded behind locked doors.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Return the Painting** | Give it back to Ashworth | +5 Stability, +5 Individual. Ashworth is grateful. The servant is punished (demotion within First Class service). Art is preserved in its original context. The class system's property rights are upheld. Companion: Vivienne -5 (she thinks her father's priorities are warped), Lord Ashworth becomes an ally. |
| **B: Let the Theft Stand** | Don't intervene — what's stolen is stolen | +5 Cunning, +5 Collective. The painting enters the Kronole Network's trade circuit. It will eventually end up in Third Class, where it becomes a community treasure — hung in the Worker's Union hall. Art democratized through theft. Companion: Big Andrei +5 (redistribution), Vivienne neutral. |
| **C: Destroy Both Copies** | Burn the original and the forgery — art shouldn't be a power symbol | +5 Force, -5 Stability. Ashworth is devastated ("You destroyed a Rothko. A Rothko!"). The act is symbolically powerful — the revolution rejects the old world's values entirely. But it's also destructive and culturally nihilistic. Companion: Edgar -10 (cultural loss), Samuel +5 (power statement). |
| **D: Display It Publicly** | Hang the painting in a common area where everyone can see it | +5 Truth, +5 Collective. Neither returned nor stolen — shared. Ashworth protests but is overruled. The painting becomes a public artwork, viewed by Third Class workers and First Class citizens alike. A small act of integration that previews what post-revolution society might look like. Companion: Edgar +10 (culture for all), Vivienne +5 (progress). Faction: First Class -5 (property violated), Third Class +5 (cultural access). |

**Compounding:** Small choice, long echo. In the epilogue, the painting's fate is mentioned as a symbol of how the revolution treated the old world's treasures. Return = preservation. Theft = redistribution. Destruction = nihilism. Public display = integration. Wilford notices: "I heard about the Rothko. Tell me what you think it's worth."

**Ledger Impact:** Individual/Collective (primary), Truth/Stability (secondary)

## Zone 6: The Sanctum & Engine (Cars 83-103)

### Choice 21: The Order's Fate

**Car:** 95 (The Gauntlet — Ezra Boss Encounter)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining)
**Trigger:** The player confronts Ezra and the Order of the Engine.

**Context:** The Order is the train's last organized defense between the player and Wilford. It is also a genuine faith community that provides meaning to hundreds of people. Destroying it eliminates a threat. Reforming it requires nuance. Ignoring it means leaving a theocratic power structure intact.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Destroy the Order** | Defeat Ezra, dismantle the Order, secularize the Sanctum | +10 Force, +10 Truth. Ezra is defeated (combat encounter). The Order's infrastructure is dismantled. Acolytes are dispersed. The faith community loses its structure — some find peace, others lose the only meaning they had. The Sanctum becomes a secular zone. Companion: all companions variable. Faction: Order -100 (eliminated). |
| **B: Reform the Order** | Work with Ember to transform the Order into a non-political faith community | +10 Stability, +10 Future. Requires Ember's trust and Kessler's support (from Zone 2). Ezra is removed (peacefully if possible, by force if necessary). Ember becomes High Priest. The Order continues to provide community and meaning without eugenics, forced confession, or political power. Companion: Father Brennan +20 (faith preserved), Ember becomes a permanent ally. |
| **C: The Compassion Path** | Listen to Ezra — really listen — and let the Engine speak | +15 Mercy, +10 Individual. The pilgrim approach: the player enters the Gauntlet as a seeker, not a conqueror. Ezra preaches, and the player listens. What emerges is a broken man hearing a machine and finding God in the noise. Ezra allows passage: "The Engine says you hear it too." The Order is unchanged — but Ezra's grip loosens, creating space for Ember's reforms. Companion: Father Brennan +15, ATLAS +10 (resonance with machine consciousness). |
| **D: Use the Medical Truth** | Diagnose Ezra's condition — the voices are hallucinations from chemical exposure | +15 Truth, -5 Mercy. Requires medical evidence from Dr. Asha or Cold Lab records. The diagnosis shatters the Acolytes' faith. Ezra fights alone. The encounter becomes tragic rather than heroic — the player is defeating a sick man, not a prophet. The Order collapses from disillusionment. Companion: Marta +10 (medical truth), Father Brennan -10 (faith destroyed). |

**Compounding:** The Order's fate shapes the endgame's spiritual dimension. A destroyed Order means the post-revolution train has no faith structure. A reformed Order provides social cohesion. The compassion path creates a tolerant spirituality. The medical truth creates a secular, rationalist culture. Wilford references each: "You dealt with Ezra. / You cured Ezra. / You listened to Ezra. Tell me — does the Engine speak?"

**Ledger Impact:** All five axes. Second most Ledger-dependent choice after Beaumont.

---

### Choice 22: The Eugenics Records

**Car:** 93 (Eugenics Lab)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** Helena Frost's genetic data and eugenics program records.

**Context:** The eugenics program is morally abhorrent. It is also scientifically sound — the genetic diversity data is real, and the train's population faces a genuine genetic crisis. The program's methods are monstrous, but the problem it addresses is legitimate.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Destroy Everything** | Burn the lab, destroy the records, end the program absolutely | +10 Force, +10 Individual. The eugenics program ends. Separated couples are reunited. But the genetic diversity data — legitimate science — is lost. The population's genetic future is unknown. The problem doesn't disappear because the records do. Companion: Marta +10, Dr. Min-jun -10 (scientific loss). Faction: Order -15, moral victory. |
| **B: Preserve the Science, End the Program** | Keep the genetic data, destroy the program's implementation records | +10 Pragmatism, +10 Truth. The population genetics data is preserved for legitimate medical use. The forced pairing records, separation orders, and "selection" criteria are destroyed. Helena's scientific work is acknowledged; her ethical violations are eliminated. This is the compromise position. Companion: Dr. Min-jun +15, Marta +5. |
| **C: Reform the Program** | Transform the eugenics program into a voluntary genetic counseling service | +10 Stability, +10 Future. Helena's expertise is redirected: instead of forced pairings, she provides genetic information to couples who want it. No coercion, no selection — just data. The genetic crisis is addressed through education rather than force. Companion: Father Brennan +10, Dr. Min-jun +10. |
| **D: Expose the Victims** | Publish the records of everyone affected — separated couples, forced pairings, children born of the program | +15 Truth, -5 Stability. The personal records are made public. Families discover the truth about their pairings. Children learn they were bred, not born of love. The truth is devastating but empowering — people can now make informed choices about their relationships. The social disruption is significant. Companion: Edgar +10, variable others. |

**Compounding:** The genetic diversity data is critical for the Exodus ending — if the train opens its doors, the surviving population's genetic viability determines whether humanity has a future outside. A player who destroyed the data must make the Exodus decision blind. A player who preserved it can make an informed choice.

**Ledger Impact:** Truth/Stability (primary), Mercy/Pragmatism (secondary)

---

### Choice 23: The Engine Room

**Car:** 101-103 (The Engine)
**Tier:** 3 (Major Moral)
**Trigger:** The player enters the Engine room and sees the machine that has sustained humanity for seventeen years.

**Context:** The Engine is magnificent. It is also dependent on child labor, powered by a fuel source that is depleting, and controlled by a system designed to maintain inequality. The player is standing inside the mechanism that keeps 2,800 people alive — and the mechanism is built on suffering.

**Options:**

| Option | Action | Consequences |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **A: Preserve It** | Commit to keeping the Engine running exactly as it is — including the child labor | +10 Pragmatism, -15 Mercy. The most horrifying rational choice: the Engine works. Changing it risks failure. The children suffer so everyone lives. This is Wilford's argument, and the player is accepting it. Companion: all companions -10 to -15 (except ATLAS, neutral). Faction: universal moral cost. |
| **B: Modify It** | Work with Kazakov (if available) to redesign the maintenance systems for adult access | +10 Pragmatism, +10 Future. Requires Kazakov as an ally. The Engine is modified over time — the children are removed, adult-accessible components are installed. The transition is risky (Engine efficiency drops temporarily) but achievable. This is the engineering solution to a moral problem. Companion: Yuki +20, Marta +15. |
| **C: Shut It Down** | Turn off the Engine. Stop the train. Open the doors | +15 Force, +15 Future, -15 Stability. The most radical choice in the game. The Engine stops. The train coasts to a halt. The doors open. Whatever is outside — survivable or not — the train's system ends. This is only viable if the Thaw data supports exterior survival. Without Thaw evidence, this is suicide for 2,800 people. Companion: Kira +25, all others variable (terrified or hopeful). |
| **D: Let Luka Decide** | Ask the child who has lived inside the Engine what should happen to it | +15 Mercy, +10 Individual. The most human choice. Luka has spent seven years inside the machine. He knows it better than anyone. His answer: "It's tired. Let it rest." This is not engineering advice — it is a child's wisdom. Whether the player follows it is up to them, but asking elevates Luka from victim to agent. Companion: all companions +5 (dignity). |

**Compounding:** This choice feeds directly into the Wilford conversation and the ending selection. Each option frames the final encounter differently:
- Preserve: Wilford says "You understand now"
- Modify: Wilford says "You think you can fix what I built?"
- Shut down: Wilford says "You're willing to kill everyone for an idea"
- Let Luka decide: Wilford says nothing — for the first time, he has no argument

**Ledger Impact:** All five axes at maximum weight.

### Choice 24: Wilford's Question

**Car:** 103 (The Conductor's Cabin)
**Tier:** 4 (Zone-Defining — FINAL)
**Trigger:** The final encounter with Wilford.

**Context:** Wilford sits in his chair. The Engine hums behind him. He has one question: "Now that you've seen everything — what would you do differently?" The player's answer, shaped by every choice across 103 cars, determines the ending.

**Options:**

| Option | Path | Ending |
|--------|------|--------|
| **A: "I'd burn it down and start over."** | The Revolution | The player seizes control. The class system is abolished. A new Council governs. The train continues, reformed. Whether this new system is better depends on the player's choices — who they allied with, who they betrayed, what institutions they preserved or destroyed. The Hidden Ledger determines whether the revolution becomes democracy, military dictatorship, or mob rule. |
| **B: "I'd do what you did. But better."** | The New Wilford | The player replaces Wilford. The system continues with modifications. This is the pragmatist ending — the player has decided that hierarchy is necessary but can be made less cruel. The epilogue shows the player making the same compromises Wilford made, or finding ways to avoid them. The Hidden Ledger determines whether "better" means genuinely better or just differently bad. |
| **C: "I'd open the doors."** | The Exodus | The player stops the Engine and opens the train. Survivors walk into a world that is cold but warming. Not everyone survives. But the train — and everything it represents — ends. This requires Thaw evidence and is the highest-risk, highest-reward ending. The Hidden Ledger determines how many survive and what kind of society they build. |
| **D: "I don't know. And I don't think you do either."** | The Eternal Loop | The player refuses to answer. Wilford smiles: "Honesty. Finally." The train continues. Nothing changes — but everything has been documented. The truth exists now. Future generations will have access to the Archive, the evidence, the records. Change is deferred, not denied. The Hidden Ledger determines whether this is wisdom or cowardice. |
| **E: (Secret)** | The Bridge | Available only if the player achieved specific conditions across all five Ledger axes. The player proposes something Wilford hasn't considered: connection between the train and the outside world. Not exile, not isolation — a bridge. The train stops periodically in warming zones, allowing controlled exterior access while maintaining the Engine as a mobile base. This requires maximum diplomatic skill, Thaw evidence, Engine modification capability, and a coalition across all factions. The rarest and most hopeful ending. |
| **F: (Secret)** | The Derailment | Available only if the player chose nihilistic options throughout the game. The player destroys the Engine. Not to free people — to end the experiment. "None of us deserved this." The train stops. The doors don't open. The Engine dies. What happens next is left ambiguous. The darkest ending, reserved for players who found no hope in 103 cars. |

**Compounding:** This is not a single choice — it is the sum of all choices. The Hidden Ledger weights from every previous moral decision determine which options are available and how each ending plays out. A player cannot reach the Bridge ending through ruthlessness. A player cannot reach the Derailment through mercy. The game's final moral choice is the shape of the player's entire journey.

**Ledger Impact:** Final resolution of all five axes. The ending is the Ledger made narrative.

### The Hidden Ledger — Final Scores

| Axis | Low Score Ending Tendency | High Score Ending Tendency |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mercy | The New Wilford, The Derailment | The Revolution, The Bridge |
| Pragmatism | The Eternal Loop | The New Wilford, The Revolution |
| Truth | The Eternal Loop, The Bridge | The Exodus, The Revolution |
| Stability | The Derailment, The Exodus | The New Wilford, The Eternal Loop |
| Force | The Revolution, The Derailment | The New Wilford |
| Cunning | The Bridge, The Eternal Loop | The New Wilford |
| Individual | The Exodus, The Bridge | Various |
| Collective | The Revolution | Various |
| Present | The Derailment, The Eternal Loop | Various |
| Future | The Exodus, The Bridge | Various |

The ending is not determined by a single score but by the interaction of all five axes. A high-Mercy, high-Truth, high-Future player reaches the Bridge. A high-Force, low-Mercy, low-Stability player reaches the Derailment. Most players land somewhere in between, and the endings have multiple variations based on the specific Ledger profile.
