## Zone 1: The Tail (Cars 1-15)

### 1. "The Elder" — Grandmother Sook-ja

**Full Name:** Park Sook-ja
**Age:** 74
**Location:** Car 5 (Elders' Car)
**Role:** Oral historian, keeper of pre-freeze memories
**Faction:** Tailies (Core generation, Engine Atheist)

**Personality:** Patient, sharp-witted despite her age, ruthlessly honest. She remembers the boarding — every death, every betrayal, every kindness. She is the Tail's living archive: who married whom, which children were taken, which promises Gilliam made and broke. She speaks in proverbs from a language most Tailies don't understand (Korean), then translates with a barbed smile. Children love her. Adults fear what she remembers.

**Appearance:** Small, stooped, with deep lines around her eyes. Hair white and cropped close (lice prevention, Year 2 — she never grew it back). Wears three layers of salvaged clothing and a single luxury: a silk scarf she stole from a Jackboot's pocket during the second revolt.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Sook-ja was a retired schoolteacher who boarded in Seoul during the final evacuation. She lost her husband and grandson in the crush at Car 1. She does not speak about them — instead, she memorized every name of every person who died in the Tail. All 400+. She recites them at the memorial wall on the anniversary of boarding, and it takes her three hours. This ritual is the Tail's most sacred tradition.

*Motivation:* Ensure the dead are not forgotten. Ensure the living learn from the dead. She supports the revolution not because she believes it will succeed, but because she believes the attempt matters more than the outcome.

*What She Knows:* She knows Gilliam's secret — not the specifics, but the shape of it. "That man carries a weight that isn't grief. Grief sits on your shoulders. Guilt sits in your stomach. Watch where he puts his hands when he thinks no one is looking." She will not share this unless the player earns her trust through the Recitation quest.

**Quests:**

1. **The Recitation** — Sook-ja asks the player to find three names she has forgotten from Cars 10-12 (the Dark Car and Kronole Den). These are people who retreated to the dark and were forgotten. Finding evidence of their names (scratched into walls, on personal effects) and reporting back earns her trust and unlocks her knowledge about Gilliam's behavior. *Reward:* Faction rep +10, unlocks dialogue about Gilliam's secret, grants the "Memory Keeper" perk (+5% XP from discovering lore items).

2. **The Last Lesson** — Sook-ja wants to teach one more class. She asks the player to gather 5 children from Cars 1-5 and bring them to her in Car 5. The lesson is about the old world — not nostalgia, but warning. Completing this quest changes the children's dialogue for the rest of the game (they ask harder questions, challenge assumptions). *Reward:* Companion loyalty +5 (all companions), unique dialogue option with Wilford in Zone 7.

---

### 2. Black Marketeer — "Nix One"

**Full Name:** Nikolai Petrov (goes by "Nix One")
**Age:** 48
**Location:** Car 13 (Smuggler's Cache), with contacts in Cars 7, 12
**Role:** Black market kingpin, information broker
**Faction:** Tailies (pragmatic neutral — trades with everyone)

**Personality:** Charming, transactional, morally unbothered. Nix One sees the train as a market. Every resource has a price. Every secret is inventory. He is not cruel — cruelty is bad for business. He is not kind — kindness is unprofitable. He is the most reliable person on the train, because his reliability is commercially motivated.

**Appearance:** Lean, scarred hands (acid burns from early Kronole processing), perpetual half-smile. Wears a coat with dozens of interior pockets, each containing something tradeable. Missing his left pinky finger (payment for a debt in Year 4 — "the interest rate was steep").

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Nix One was a logistics manager for a shipping company before the freeze. He boarded the train with nothing but an understanding of supply chains. Within a year, he had established the Tail's first black market. By Year 5, his network extended into Third Class through maintenance tunnels and bribed Jackboots. His partner "Nix Two" (already documented) handles Tail-side operations while Nix One manages the cross-zone trade.

*The Network:* Nix One's smuggling operation moves goods through the undercarriage — the maintenance tunnels beneath the train floor. He employs children (not Engine-bound — tunnel runners who carry small goods between cars). This is exploitative but consensual, and the runners are well-compensated by Tail standards. The moral ambiguity is intentional.

*Motivation:* Survival through commerce. Nix One has no political allegiance. He will sell weapons to the revolution and sell intelligence to the Jackboots — not simultaneously (that's suicide), but sequentially (that's business). He genuinely likes people, in the way a bartender likes regulars: warmly, professionally, from behind a counter.

**Quests:**

1. **The Supply Line** — Nix One needs a tunnel runner for a critical delivery to Third Class (Car 18). The player can volunteer or recruit someone. The delivery contains medicine — but also a sealed package Nix One won't identify. If the player opens the package, they discover it contains Kronole precursors. Confronting Nix One leads to a negotiation: he'll cut the Kronole trade if the player finds him an alternative revenue stream (leads to side quest in Zone 2). *Reward:* Access to Nix One's full inventory, faction rep +5 or -5 depending on choices.

2. **The Debt Collector** — Someone in Car 7 owes Nix One. The debt isn't money — it's a promise. Anvil (the Forgemaster) agreed to build a specific tool for Nix One and hasn't delivered. The tool is a master key for maintenance tunnel hatches. Anvil refuses because he knows the key would be used for Kronole smuggling. The player mediates. *Reward:* Either Nix One's loyalty (he becomes a reliable fence for the rest of the game) or Anvil's respect (he forges the player a custom weapon).

### 3. Kronole Queen — Zhora Vasilieva

**Full Name:** Zhora Vasilieva (already referenced in faction lore as "Zhora, Den Master")
**Age:** 39
**Location:** Car 12 (Kronole Den)
**Role:** Kronole chemist, den operator, protector of addicts
**Faction:** Tailies (Kronole Network aligned)

**Personality:** Fiercely maternal toward her "patients" (she refuses to call them addicts), scientifically precise about chemistry, emotionally devastated by what she's become. Zhora is the Tail's best chemist — she could have been its doctor if circumstances were different. Instead, she refines Kronole because it's the only way to manage the Tail's pain. She is not a drug lord; she is a harm-reduction specialist operating without alternatives.

**Appearance:** Strong build, chemical-stained fingers, burn scars on her forearms from early processing accidents. Hair tied back tight. Eyes that are simultaneously warm and exhausted. Wears a modified apron with chemical-resistant patches.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Zhora was a pharmaceutical chemist who boarded in Moscow. Her husband died in Year 1 (crushed in the Dark Time). She discovered Kronole's properties by accident — a maintenance fluid mixed with biological compounds created a psychoactive substance that numbed pain and, in small doses, induced vivid hallucinations of the outside world. She refined it not to profit but to give people an escape from the relentless suffering of Tail life.

*The Ethical Knot:* Kronole is addictive, damaging, and necessary. Without it, the Tail's suicide rate would spike (it did, in the two months when the supply ran out in Year 9). Zhora knows this. She also knows she's poisoning people slowly. She manages this contradiction by maintaining strict dosing protocols — but addiction doesn't respect protocols.

*The Visions:* Some deep Kronole users report seeing the same thing: a field of green grass, sunlight, a door in the distance. Glass (the Kronole Prophet, already documented) claims these visions are real — that Kronole opens a window to the world outside. Zhora dismisses this publicly. Privately, she wonders.

*Motivation:* Manage suffering. Zhora doesn't want power — she wants the revolution to succeed so she can stop making Kronole. But she also knows that revolution means violence, and violence means casualties, and casualties mean more people in her den. She is trapped in a cycle she understands perfectly and cannot escape.

**Quests:**

1. **The Better Formula** — Zhora has been working on a non-addictive version of Kronole — a painkiller without the psychoactive properties. She needs a chemical compound available only in Car 6 (Sickbay). Getting it means convincing Asha to share scarce medical supplies. The player brokers the deal. *Reward:* "Clean Kronole" becomes available as a healing item (weaker than regular Kronole but no addiction mechanic), Zhora's faction rep +15, shifts the Kronole Question moral choice.

2. **The Prophet's Warning** — Glass has been consuming dangerous doses and claims the visions are getting clearer. Zhora asks the player to either talk Glass down or find out if there's any scientific basis for the visions (requires investigating the chemical composition with equipment from Car 7). *Reward:* Lore revelation about Kronole's connection to the Thaw evidence, companion loyalty shift (companions react differently to whether the player validated or dismissed the visions).

### 4. Breachman Captain — "Ironside" Dara Osei

**Full Name:** Dara Osei (callsign "Ironside")
**Age:** 41
**Location:** Car 11 (Freezer Breach), patrols Cars 9-14
**Role:** Leader of the Tail's breach repair crew
**Faction:** Tailies (Core generation, Thaw Believer — secret)

**Personality:** Stoic, methodical, physically fearless. Ironside is the person the Tail calls when the hull breaches. She has patched seventeen breaches in seventeen years, working in sub-zero conditions with improvised tools and salvaged sealant. She has lost three fingers to frostbite and doesn't mention it. She treats mortal danger the way a plumber treats a leaky pipe: it's just work.

**Appearance:** Muscular, medium height, dark skin marked with frostbite scars on her cheeks and hands. Wears a heavily modified cold-weather suit cobbled from Jackboot armor scraps, insulation foam, and rubber sheeting. Carries a welding torch she calls "Mercy" (it seals breaches; it also kills).

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Dara was a structural engineer who boarded in Accra. She was one of the few Tailies with technical skills useful to the train's survival, which gave her a unique status: the Jackboots occasionally request her services for hull repairs in forward sections (under armed escort). This means she has seen more of the train than almost any Tailie — fragments of Third Class, glimpses of the Working Spine. She never talks about what she saw. But she started believing in the Thaw after she noticed ice formations on the exterior hull changing pattern in Year 15.

*The Thaw Evidence:* Ironside has been secretly documenting temperature readings at breach points. Over the past two years, the external temperature has risen by 0.3°C. This is within measurement error — but the trend is consistent. She believes the world is warming. She has told no one except the Thaw Believers, a secret cell of 8 Tailies who meet in Car 11 during breach drills.

*Motivation:* Open a door. Not metaphorically — literally. Ironside wants to open the train's exterior access hatch and test whether survival outside is possible. She needs cold-weather equipment, temperature sensors, and someone willing to step outside. The revolution is useful to her only because it might give her access to better equipment.

**Quests:**

1. **Breach Protocol** — A new breach opens in Car 11 during the player's passage. Ironside recruits the player for emergency repair. This is a timed environmental challenge: seal the breach before the car drops below -20°C. Success earns Ironside's trust and access to the Thaw Believers' evidence. Failure results in NPC deaths and permanent cold damage to the car. *Reward:* Thaw evidence (lore item affecting endgame), Ironside available as a temporary combat ally for Cars 12-15, faction rep +10.

2. **The Outside** — After the breach quest, Ironside reveals her temperature data and asks the player to help her obtain a functional temperature probe from Car 8 (Listening Post) or Car 15 (Threshold checkpoint). This sets up a long-running quest that pays off in Zone 4 (Working Spine) when the player can access proper instruments. *Reward:* Critical path item for the Exodus ending, faction rep +10 with Thaw Believers.

### 5. The Surgeon — Dr. Asha Ramachandran

**Full Name:** Asha Ramachandran
**Age:** 52
**Location:** Car 6 (Sickbay)
**Role:** The Tail's only trained physician, Council Medical member
**Faction:** Tailies (Council, Engine Atheist)

**Personality:** Clinically precise, emotionally exhausted, morally rigid. Asha practices medicine with nothing: no antibiotics (mostly), no surgical tools (improvised), no anesthesia (Kronole, which she despises using). She has saved hundreds of lives through sheer competence and refuses to triage by political value — she treats everyone equally, which makes her both the most respected and most frustrating person in the Tail. She will not let a revolutionary skip the queue ahead of a Kronole addict.

**Appearance:** Thin, graying hair pulled back, steady hands (the steadiest in the Tail — people comment on it). Wears a stained medical coat she has maintained for seventeen years through obsessive patching. Carries a leather roll of improvised surgical tools.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Asha was an emergency room surgeon in Mumbai who boarded during the Indian evacuation. She lost her family — husband and two children — at the boarding point (trampled in the crowd). She has never spoken about them. Her medical practice in the Tail began on Day 1 when she set a broken arm with a strip of metal and a piece of cloth. She hasn't stopped since.

*The Ethical Burden:* Asha knows about the sedative in the protein blocks (Old Maggie told her in Year 3). She has kept this secret from the Council because she calculated that the sedative, while ethically abhorrent, reduces violence by approximately 30% — which saves more lives than the information would. She hates herself for this calculus. She hates that it's correct.

*The Cough:* The endemic respiratory disease killing Tailies is tuberculosis, modified by the train's closed air system. Asha knows this but cannot treat it without antibiotics that don't exist in the Tail. She has been sending requests forward through Nix One's network for years. None have been answered.

*Motivation:* Save lives. That's it. Not the revolution, not politics, not ideology. If the revolution produces fewer corpses than the status quo, she supports it. If it produces more, she opposes it. She judges everything by body count.

**Quests:**

1. **The Cough Cure** — Asha needs antibiotics. A shipment exists in Car 16 (Third Class medical stores). She asks the player to obtain them — by trade, by theft, or by negotiation with Third Class contacts. The method the player chooses has consequences: theft poisons Third Class relations, trade costs precious Tail resources, negotiation requires a favor to be repaid in Zone 2. *Reward:* Asha's loyalty, "The Cough" debuff removed from Tail NPCs, faction rep +10 (Tail) and variable (Third Class).

2. **Triage** — Feeds into the Medicine Allocation moral choice. Before the choice triggers, Asha gives the player a private briefing on each patient's prognosis. If the player asks the right questions, Asha reveals her utilitarian philosophy — and her self-loathing about it. This quest has no mechanical reward; it changes the moral choice's framing. *Reward:* Additional option in the Medicine Allocation choice (Asha's recommendation), deeper understanding of consequences.

### 6. The Child — Timmy Novak

**Full Name:** Timmy Novak
**Age:** 9
**Location:** Car 4 (Nursery), wanders Cars 1-7
**Role:** Child, potential taken-child subplot
**Faction:** Tailies (Tail-born, innocent)

**Personality:** Curious, resilient, unnervingly perceptive. Timmy has never seen the sky, never tasted fresh food, never known quiet (the train vibrates constantly). He is not sad about this — he doesn't know what he's missing. His world is the Tail, and within it, he has found wonder: the star ceiling Josie painted, the sound the hull makes in different weather, the way light bends through the ice on Car 11's walls. He asks questions adults can't answer: "What color is the sky?" "Do trees make noise?" "Is the Engine alive?"

**Appearance:** Small for his age (malnutrition), dark hair, quick eyes that miss nothing. Wears oversized hand-me-downs. Always carries a piece of chalk (his most treasured possession — he draws maps of the train on floors and walls).

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Born in Car 4, Year 8. Mother alive (a quiet woman named Elena who works in the Protein Kitchen). Father unknown (Elena won't say; it's rumored to be a Jackboot, which would explain why Timmy hasn't been taken forward — someone is protecting him). Timmy is Josie's favorite, though she tries not to show it. He is the embodiment of the Tail's future — everything they're fighting for.

*The Maps:* Timmy draws maps compulsively. His maps are surprisingly accurate — he pieces together information from adult conversations, listening post data he overhears, and his own observations. His map of Cars 1-15 is more detailed than anything the Council has. He has started mapping forward cars based on descriptions from Nix One's runners. These maps are mechanically useful to the player.

*The Taking:* If the player does not intervene, Timmy is taken forward in the gap between Zones 1 and 2. This becomes a powerful emotional motivator for the rest of the game. If the player intervenes (hiding Timmy during the Jackboot sweep in Car 9), Timmy survives but the Jackboots take another child instead — the player's choice prevents one tragedy by enabling another.

*Motivation:* Timmy wants to see what's in the next car. Always the next car. He has no concept of revolution or politics — he just wants to explore. This innocent curiosity is the purest expression of why the revolution matters: so children can walk forward without fear.

**Quests:**

1. **The Map Maker** — Timmy offers the player his hand-drawn map of Cars 1-15 in exchange for a promise: bring him something from a forward car. Any forward car. Something he's never seen. This quest persists through the entire game. Every time the player finds an unusual item in a forward zone, they can choose to save it for Timmy. Delivering items to Timmy (via Josie, who maintains contact) triggers short, heartbreaking dialogue. *Reward:* Timmy's map (+5% exploration discovery rate in Zone 1), ongoing emotional thread, unique epilogue scene.

2. **Hide and Seek** — When the Jackboots come for children (Car 9 sequence), Timmy runs to the player. The player can hide him (skill check: Cunning, medium difficulty) or surrender him. Hiding him succeeds but forces the Jackboots to take a different child (randomly selected from named Nursery children). This choice haunts the player — and Timmy, who eventually learns what happened. *Reward:* Timmy survives (affects epilogue), but guilt mechanic triggers, and the taken child's parents become hostile.

## Zone 2: Third Class (Cars 16-30)

### 7. The Union Boss — Petra Kovic

**Full Name:** Petra Kovic
**Age:** 44
**Location:** Car 29 (Worker's Union Hall)
**Role:** Head of the Third Class Worker's Union
**Faction:** Third Class (Worker's Union, politically independent)

**Personality:** Loud, blunt, strategically brilliant. Petra runs the Union like a pre-freeze labor organizer — because she was one. She negotiates shift lengths, ration distribution, safety standards, and dispute resolution for 600 workers. She is hated by the Jackboots, tolerated by the Bureaucracy, and adored by the workers. She chain-smokes hand-rolled cigarettes made from dried insect husks (the smell is memorable).

**Appearance:** Broad-shouldered, calloused hands, a broken nose that healed crooked. Hair cut short and practical. Wears a worker's jumpsuit with the Union patch (a wrench crossed with a gear) sewn on the shoulder.

**Quests:**

1. **Union Card** — Petra will support the revolution if the player proves they're not just another Tailie burning through Third Class. She demands the player work a full shift in Car 20 (the Laundry) without complaint. This is a timed labor minigame — monotonous, exhausting, humbling. Completing it earns Union backing (critical for the Dietrich boss encounter). *Reward:* Union alliance, faction rep +15 (Third Class), access to Union resources (safe houses, information).

2. **The Strike** — A worker dies in Car 22 (Industrial). Unsafe conditions. Petra wants to organize a strike, but it risks Jackboot retaliation. The player can support the strike (risking violence), negotiate safety improvements with the Jackboot foreman (requires Charisma), or sabotage the dangerous equipment directly (requires Engineering). Each approach has different faction consequences. *Reward:* Variable — strike succeeds: faction rep +20 (Third), -10 (Jackboots). Negotiation: +10 (Third), +5 (Jackboots). Sabotage: +10 (Third), -15 (Jackboots), equipment destroyed permanently.

---

### 8. The Teacher — Sister Margaux

**Full Name:** Margaux Delacroix
**Age:** 56
**Location:** Car 27 (School Car)
**Role:** Senior teacher, secret resistance sympathizer
**Faction:** Third Class (outwardly loyal, secretly resistance)

**Personality:** Warm, subversive, patient. Sister Margaux teaches the approved Wilford curriculum by day and teaches real history after hours. She is not a revolutionary — she is an educator who believes that knowledge is the prerequisite for change. She teaches children that the world was bigger than the train. She teaches them that power is not permanent. She does this quietly, through stories framed as "lessons from the old world."

**Appearance:** Tall, thin, wire-frame glasses repaired with electrical tape. Wears a teacher's uniform (Second Class-issued) that she has personalized with a small pin: a book with wings. Her students call her "Auntie M."

**Quests:**

1. **The Hidden Curriculum** — Margaux asks the player to retrieve a confiscated book from Car 26 (the Jackboot barracks). The book is a pre-freeze history of revolutions. Getting it back requires stealth or social engineering. If the player reads the book, they gain a permanent Cunning bonus. *Reward:* +2 Cunning (permanent), Margaux becomes an informant (provides intelligence about Second Class movements), faction rep +5 (resistance).

2. **The Elevation Files** — Margaux was a colleague of the Elevation Program instructors. She has partial records of children taken from the Tail and Third Class. She gives these to the player, setting up the Melena Voss confrontation in Zone 3. *Reward:* Elevation Program evidence (critical item for Voss confrontation), lore unlock about the taken children.

---

### 9. The Preacher — Brother Kessler

**Full Name:** Anton Kessler
**Age:** 62
**Location:** Car 23 (Chapel of the Engine)
**Role:** Third Class chapel leader, Order of the Engine clergy
**Faction:** Order of the Engine (moderate faction)

**Personality:** Genuinely kind, theologically flexible, politically naive. Kessler believes in the Engine as a source of hope, not as Wilford's tool. He runs the Third Class chapel as a community center — meals, counseling, children's activities — funded by the Order but operated on his own terms. He is aware that the central Order (under Ezra) has become extreme but believes reform is possible from within.

**Appearance:** Heavyset, balding, kind eyes. Wears the Order's standard robes but has embroidered them with flowers — a small rebellion against the Order's austere aesthetic. His hands shake (early Parkinson's, undiagnosed).

**Quests:**

1. **The Schism** — Kessler has received orders from Ezra to begin preaching the Engine's "divine selection" doctrine — a eugenics-adjacent ideology that justifies the class system as the Engine's will. Kessler refuses but doesn't know how to resist without being replaced by a hardliner. The player can help Kessler draft a counter-sermon (dialogue challenge), help him hide his disobedience (stealth), or convince him to openly defy Ezra (which gets him expelled but creates a resistance cell). *Reward:* Variable — Kessler's chapel becomes a safe house (if hidden) or a rallying point (if public), Order faction rep shifts.

2. **Confession** — Kessler offers to hear the player's "confession" — a mechanic where the player can reflect on choices made so far. Kessler provides moral context without judgment. This has no mechanical reward but changes companion loyalty calculations for the next zone (companions who were present hear the confession and recalibrate their opinions). *Reward:* Companion loyalty recalculation, unique dialogue options.

---

### 10. The Fence — Cora "Switchblade" Mendez

**Full Name:** Cora Mendez
**Age:** 31
**Location:** Car 19 (Third Class market corridor), mobile
**Role:** Fence, information broker, Kronole distributor
**Faction:** Kronole Network (Third Class branch)

**Personality:** Fast-talking, street-smart, deeply loyal to her own. Cora grew up in Third Class and learned early that information is more valuable than goods. She operates as the Kronole Network's Third Class hub — buying, selling, and trading contraband. She is Nix One's primary Third Class contact and runs the tunnel-runner network that connects the Tail to the forward sections.

**Appearance:** Wiry, quick-moving, multiple piercings made from scrap metal. Dark hair dyed with chemical residue (it has a faint blue-green tint). Carries a switchblade she made herself — hence the name.

**Quests:**

1. **The Tunnel Run** — Cora needs someone to run a package through the maintenance tunnels from Car 19 to Car 28 (near the Second Class border). The tunnels are dangerous — narrow, unlit, with occasional steam vents. The player navigates a hazardous environment and discovers evidence of children's footprints in the dust (the missing children passed through here). *Reward:* Access to Cora's tunnel network (fast travel between specific cars), lore discovery about missing children's route.

2. **The Rat** — Someone is informing the Jackboots about Cora's operations. She suspects three people and asks the player to investigate. The informant turns out to be a desperate parent whose child is being held as leverage. The player chooses: expose the informant (protects the network but dooms the family), hide the truth (Cora's next shipment gets raided), or confront the Jackboot holding the child (combat encounter). *Reward:* Variable — Cora's trust, moral weight, potential ally or enemy.

---

### 11. The Medic — "Doc" Yusuf Adeyemi

**Full Name:** Yusuf Adeyemi
**Age:** 37
**Location:** Car 25 (Third Class Clinic)
**Role:** Third Class physician, overworked and underfunded
**Faction:** Third Class (neutral, humanitarian)

**Personality:** Sardonic, competent, running on fumes. Yusuf treats 600 workers with supplies meant for 100. He has dark humor about mortality ("Your arm's broken. Good news — I've set six this week, I'm getting better. Bad news — I'm out of splints, so I'm using a spoon."). He is not political — he treats Jackboots and workers with equal care, which makes both sides suspicious.

**Appearance:** Tired eyes, close-cropped beard, forearms permanently ink-stained (he marks patients' skin with diagnosis notes because he ran out of paper in Year 8).

**Quests:**

1. **Supply Run** — Yusuf needs surgical supplies from Second Class (Car 35, medical stores). The supplies exist but are allocated exclusively to Second Class residents. The player can steal them, negotiate a trade (Yusuf has medical knowledge Second Class doctors don't — Tail diseases), or forge a requisition order. *Reward:* Yusuf's clinic upgraded (heals player and companions to full), faction rep +5 (Third Class).

2. **The Autopsy** — A worker dies under suspicious circumstances in Car 22. Yusuf suspects poisoning, not accident. He asks the player to investigate while he performs an autopsy. The death was caused by contaminated water — deliberately contaminated by a Jackboot who was covering up a water treatment failure. Exposing this creates a political crisis. *Reward:* Evidence usable against Jackboot authority, faction rep +10 (Third Class), -10 (Jackboots).

---

### 12. The Foreman — Ivan "Iron Ivan" Borodin

**Full Name:** Ivan Borodin
**Age:** 53
**Location:** Car 22 (Industrial Car)
**Role:** Factory foreman, reluctant Jackboot collaborator
**Faction:** Third Class (Jackboot-adjacent, conflicted)

**Personality:** Gruff, fair within unfair constraints, haunted. Ivan runs the Industrial Car — the factory that produces replacement parts, tools, and processed goods for the entire train. He answers to the Jackboots but protects his workers when he can. He has made compromises he can't take back: he once turned in a union organizer who was subsequently sent to the Drawers. The organizer's wife still works in his factory. She doesn't speak to him.

**Appearance:** Massive hands, burn scars, permanent soot stains. Wears a foreman's apron over worker's coveralls. A wedding ring he still wears though his wife died in Year 6.

**Quests:**

1. **The Quota** — The Jackboots demand double production this month. Meeting the quota means unsafe conditions (workers will be injured). Failing the quota means ration cuts for all Third Class. Ivan asks the player to help: find a way to meet production through efficiency (Engineering check), negotiate reduced quotas (Charisma check with Jackboot liaison), or sabotage the records (Cunning check). *Reward:* Variable — Ivan's trust, worker safety preserved or compromised, faction consequences.

2. **The Organizer's Wife** — Mrs. Kozlov works in Ivan's factory and won't speak to him. Ivan asks the player to mediate — not for forgiveness, but for functional communication. The player learns that Mrs. Kozlov has been conducting her own quiet resistance (hiding defective parts that could be used as weapons). Ivan can either support this or report it. The player influences his choice. *Reward:* Hidden weapon cache (if protected), Ivan and Mrs. Kozlov reconciliation (affects Zone 2 morale), faction rep +5.

---

## Zone 3: Second Class (Cars 31-48)

### 13. The Archivist — Konstantin Volkov

**Full Name:** Konstantin Volkov
**Age:** 67
**Location:** Car 39 (The Archive)
**Role:** Chief Archivist, keeper of the train's records
**Faction:** Second Class (Bureaucracy, secretly neutral)

**Personality:** Meticulous, dry-humored, quietly subversive. Konstantin has maintained the Archive for fifteen years — every census record, every death report, every requisition order, every memo from Wilford's office. He is the train's institutional memory. He files everything, annotates everything, and forgets nothing. He also ensures that certain records are... accessible to those who know where to look.

**Appearance:** Tall, thin, stooped from years of bending over documents. Wire-rimmed glasses, ink-stained fingers, a precisely trimmed beard. Wears the Bureaucracy's standard gray suit, immaculate despite its age.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Konstantin was a university librarian in Saint Petersburg. He boarded with a Second Class ticket purchased by the university (they sent their most valuable staff member). He has no family on the train. He has the Archive.

*The Secret Index:* Konstantin maintains a hidden index — a cross-reference system that connects seemingly innocuous documents into a devastating picture of Wilford's regime. Ration allocation records prove deliberate starvation of the Tail. Jackboot deployment logs show the timing of child takings. Engineering reports document the Engine's child-sized access panels. The information is all there, in the official records — Konstantin simply made it findable.

*Motivation:* Truth. Konstantin believes that institutions destroy themselves — they just need accurate records. He does not fight, does not organize, does not resist. He simply files. And he ensures the files are discoverable. "History is not written by the victors. It is written by the archivists. The victors just decide who reads it."

**Quests:**

1. **The Deep Archive** — Konstantin offers the player access to the Archive's restricted section — but only if they can pass his test. The test is not combat or skill — it's a conversation. Konstantin asks the player about their journey: who they helped, who they hurt, what they learned. Based on the answers, he decides what records to share. A player who has been attentive to lore and documentation receives the full secret index. A player who rushed through gets surface-level records. *Reward:* Variable — full secret index (massive lore dump, evidence for multiple quest resolutions, Voss confrontation material, trial evidence for Okonkwo), or partial records.

2. **The Missing Page** — A critical document has been removed from the Archive. Konstantin suspects the Surveillance Hub (Car 44) took it. The document is an early memo from Wilford to Kazakov about "Engine sustainment requirements" — the first written evidence of the child labor program. Recovering it requires infiltrating the Surveillance Hub. *Reward:* The Wilford Memo (critical evidence for endgame), Konstantin's trust (he becomes a recurring information source).

### 14. The Entertainer — "Diamond" Elise Fontaine

**Full Name:** Elise Fontaine
**Age:** 42
**Location:** Car 37 (The Lounge)
**Role:** Singer, performer, social connector
**Faction:** Second Class (social neutral, everyone's friend)

**Personality:** Dazzling, perceptive, secretly despairing. Diamond Elise is the best performer on the train — a voice that makes people forget, for three minutes, that the world ended. She performs in the Second Class Lounge and, by special invitation, in First Class venues. She knows everyone's secrets because people talk to entertainers the way they talk to bartenders: as if they're furniture.

**Appearance:** Striking, with an ageless quality. Dark skin, high cheekbones, eyes that seem to be performing even in private. Wears gowns made from repurposed Second Class curtain fabric — she has a tailor friend who transforms utility into beauty.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Elise was a jazz singer in New Orleans who boarded with a Second Class ticket purchased by a wealthy patron (who did not survive boarding). She has performed every night for seventeen years. She has never missed a show. The consistency is not professionalism — it's compulsion. If she stops performing, she has to think about what she lost. She does not stop performing.

*The Information Network:* Elise's performances are intelligence-gathering operations she doesn't consciously conduct. People confess to her after shows — Jackboot officers brag about operations, Bureaucracy staff complain about directives, Second Class citizens reveal affairs and resentments. She remembers everything but uses nothing. Until now.

*Motivation:* Elise wants the train to be beautiful. Not comfortable — beautiful. She sees the revolution as inevitable and doesn't care who wins as long as someone still wants music when it's over. She will help the player because the player is interesting — and because seventeen years of listening to powerful people's secrets has made her disgusted with power.

**Quests:**

1. **The Performance** — Elise offers to arrange a performance in First Class (Car 72, the Opera House). The player can attend as her "assistant" — a cover that provides disguised access to First Class for reconnaissance. During the performance, the player overhears critical intelligence (First Class security rotations, Beaumont's schedule, location of blackmail records). *Reward:* First Class intelligence (useful for Zone 5), Elise's trust, access to her information network.

2. **The Last Song** — Elise wants to compose one original song — she has performed covers and standards for seventeen years but never her own music. She needs lyrics. She asks the player to bring her stories from across the train — one from each zone the player has visited. Each story becomes a verse. The completed song, performed in the Lounge, has a mechanical effect: every NPC who hears it gains a temporary morale buff, and the player gains a permanent Charisma bonus. *Reward:* +2 Charisma (permanent), "Diamond's Song" faction event (all Second Class faction rep +5).

### 15. The Bureaucrat — Henri Lamarque

**Full Name:** Henri Lamarque
**Age:** 50
**Location:** Car 33 (Bureaucracy Car)
**Role:** Chief Administrator, Second Class governance
**Faction:** Second Class (Bureaucracy, system loyalist)

**Personality:** Pedantic, rule-obsessed, secretly terrified. Henri runs the Bureaucracy — the administrative apparatus that manages permits, housing assignments, dispute resolution, and resource allocation for Second Class. He believes in process, procedure, and paperwork with a fervor that borders on religious. He is not evil — he is the kind of man who enforces unjust rules because "the rules are the rules" and changing them requires a form he hasn't approved yet.

**Appearance:** Precisely groomed, thinning hair combed meticulously. Wears a bureaucrat's gray suit with every button buttoned. His desk is immaculate. His hands are soft (he has never done physical labor).

**Quests:**

1. **The Permit** — The player needs a Second Class transit permit to move freely through Zone 3. Henri will issue one — if the player completes the correct paperwork. This is deliberately absurd: Form 17-B requires a reference from a Second Class citizen, which requires Form 12-A, which requires a work history, which requires Form 3-C. The player can navigate the bureaucracy (patience + Cunning), forge the documents (Cunning check), bribe Henri (he is corruptible but expensive), or bypass him entirely (stealth through restricted corridors). *Reward:* Second Class transit permit (free movement in Zone 3), Henri's relationship (ally or enemy depending on approach).

2. **The Census** — Henri discovers a discrepancy in the population records: thirty-seven people are listed as "transferred to specialized assignment" over seventeen years. None have appeared in any zone's census since. He doesn't know about the children — he thinks it's an accounting error. He asks the player to investigate. When the truth emerges, Henri's reaction defines his character: he can become an ally (horrified, willing to leak records) or an obstacle (denial, doubles down on bureaucratic loyalty). *Reward:* Census evidence (supports multiple quest chains), Henri's alignment shift.

---

### 16. The Spy — "Whisper"

**Full Name:** Unknown (goes by "Whisper")
**Age:** ~35
**Location:** Car 44 (Surveillance Hub), mobile
**Role:** Surveillance operator, double agent
**Faction:** Second Class (Surveillance, secretly working for multiple sides)

**Personality:** Paranoid, calculating, lonely. Whisper monitors the train's internal surveillance system — cameras, microphones, and informant networks. They see everything and trust nothing. They have been selling information to three factions simultaneously (Bureaucracy, Kronole Network, and an unknown third party later revealed to be Kazakov) while maintaining the appearance of loyal service. Their gender is ambiguous and they prefer it that way — harder to identify.

**Appearance:** Average height, average build, forgettable face — deliberately cultivated. Wears standard Surveillance uniform. The only distinguishing feature is their eyes: constantly moving, cataloging, recording.

**Quests:**

1. **The Dead Drop** — Whisper contacts the player through a coded message left in Car 38. They offer a trade: surveillance footage of the Jackboot command structure in exchange for a small favor — destroying a specific recording in the Surveillance Hub (Car 44). The recording shows Whisper meeting with a Kronole Network contact. The player must decide whether to trust Whisper, and whether to destroy evidence that could be useful. *Reward:* Jackboot intelligence (patrol routes, command hierarchy), Whisper's tentative trust.

2. **The Watcher** — Whisper reveals that someone else is watching the watchers. A second surveillance system exists, one that Whisper didn't install and can't access. It's in the walls — hardwired, analog, invisible to the digital system. Finding its origin leads to Wilford's personal surveillance network (installed by Kazakov in Year 3). This quest connects to the Engine's secrets. *Reward:* Discovery of Wilford's private surveillance system (lore, evidence), paranoia mechanic (some safe rooms aren't safe).

---

### 17. The Judge's Clerk — Emeka Okonkwo

**Full Name:** Emeka Okonkwo
**Age:** 28
**Location:** Car 46 (The Night Car), formerly Car 48 (Judicial Chamber)
**Role:** Former law clerk, Kronole addict, Okonkwo's estranged son
**Faction:** Kronole Network (involuntary)

**Personality:** Brilliant, broken, ashamed. Emeka inherited his mother's legal mind and his father's gentle disposition. He clerked for Magistrate Okonkwo for three years — drafting rulings, researching precedent, watching his mother build something real. Then he found the Elevation Program files. He read them. He understood what the law he served was protecting. He started using Kronole to sleep. Then to think. Then to exist.

**Appearance:** Gaunt, red-eyed, hands that tremble. Wears a clerk's formal suit that hangs loose on his diminished frame. Still carries a fountain pen in his breast pocket — a gift from his mother.

**Quests:**

1. **The Son's Testimony** — Emeka has evidence that could change the trial with Magistrate Okonkwo (Zone 3 boss encounter). He knows specific cases where the law was used to cover up Wilford's crimes. But he's too addicted to testify coherently. The player can help him get clean (requires Zhora's clean Kronole from Zone 1, if obtained) or find a way to record his testimony for playback. *Reward:* Trial evidence (critical for Okonkwo encounter), Emeka's partial recovery, emotional reunion scene with his mother.

2. **The Precedent** — Emeka remembers a specific ruling his mother made in Year 12 — a case where she ruled against a Jackboot officer who had beaten a Third Class worker. The ruling established that "no person aboard is beyond the law's protection." This precedent can be cited during the trial to force Okonkwo to apply her own standards to the Tail. Emeka can help the player find the case file in the Archive. *Reward:* Legal precedent (critical trial evidence), companion loyalty +5 (Father Brennan approves).

---

### 18. The Pharmacist — Dr. Lian Zhou

**Full Name:** Lian Zhou
**Age:** 45
**Location:** Car 35 (Medical Stores)
**Role:** Second Class pharmacist, medical supply controller
**Faction:** Second Class (medical establishment, quietly sympathetic)

**Personality:** Precise, conflicted, compassionate behind closed doors. Lian controls the Second Class medical supply chain — the antibiotics, painkillers, surgical tools, and Kronole treatment compounds that the rear cars desperately need. She distributes according to the allocation formula: Second Class first, First Class by request, Third Class by quota, Tail by never. She follows the formula because deviating means losing her position, which means someone less compassionate takes over.

**Appearance:** Neat, professional, stress lines around her mouth. Hair in a precise bun. Wears a pharmacist's white coat with the Bureaucracy seal. Her hands smell of antiseptic.

**Quests:**

1. **The Diversion** — Lian approaches the player secretly. She has been skimming small amounts from Second Class allocations and stockpiling them for Third Class and Tail distribution through unofficial channels. She needs help with a large shipment — enough antibiotics to treat the Cough in the Tail. But diverting this much will be noticed. The player helps her plan the diversion (logistics puzzle) and deals with the consequences when the shortage is discovered. *Reward:* Major medical supplies for the Tail (resolves the Cough permanently if combined with Asha's quest), Lian's alliance, risk of Second Class backlash.

2. **The Formula** — Lian has been analyzing the protein blocks and confirms what Asha suspected: they contain a sedative compound. She can synthesize a counteragent — but distributing it would cause a visible behavioral change in the Tail population (increased aggression, restlessness), tipping off the Jackboots. The player decides: distribute the counteragent (empowers the Tail but alerts the enemy) or withhold it (maintains the deception but leaves the population sedated). *Reward:* Variable — counteragent distributed: +15 faction rep (Tail), Tail NPCs gain combat buffs, Jackboots increase patrols. Withheld: moral weight, information stored for later use.

## Zone 4: Working Spine (Cars 49-62)

### 19. The Apprentice — Sasha Petrov

**Full Name:** Sasha Petrov
**Age:** 19
**Location:** Car 51 (Water Treatment)
**Role:** Engineering apprentice, youngest infrastructure crew member
**Faction:** Working Spine (loyal to Kazakov, questioning)

**Personality:** Eager, mechanically gifted, morally awakening. Sasha idolizes Chief Engineer Kazakov — he is her mentor, her father figure, her model of what competence looks like. She is the best apprentice the Working Spine has produced in a decade. She is also beginning to notice things: access panels sized for children's hands, maintenance logs with entries by workers who don't exist on the roster, Kazakov's visible flinch whenever a child is mentioned.

**Appearance:** Young, strong, perpetually oil-smeared. Short hair for safety (long hair and machinery don't mix). Wears an apprentice's coveralls with tool loops. Carries Kazakov's spare wrench like a talisman.

**Quests:**

1. **The Apprentice's Test** — Sasha needs to pass her journeyman examination. She asks the player for help with a practical test: repairing a water treatment valve under time pressure. If the player has Engineering skill, they can assist directly. If not, they can encourage her (Charisma check) or find Kazakov to mentor her through it. Completing the quest earns Sasha's loyalty — she becomes a guide through the Working Spine. *Reward:* Sasha as a guide (reveals shortcuts and hidden areas in Zone 4), faction rep +5 (Working Spine).

2. **The Child-Sized Access Panel** — Sasha shows the player an access panel she was asked to service. It's too small for any adult. She asks the player what it's for. The player can tell her the truth (devastating but honest), lie (protective but patronizing), or help her investigate herself (she discovers the truth independently). Her reaction varies but always deepens her character. *Reward:* Sasha's alignment shift (potential ally against Kazakov or advocate for a non-violent resolution), emotional scene, evidence for endgame.

---

### 20. The Cold Lab Technician — Dr. Maren Holst

**Full Name:** Maren Holst
**Age:** 49
**Location:** Car 56 (Cold Lab)
**Role:** Climate researcher, population modeler
**Faction:** Working Spine (scientific, apolitical)

**Personality:** Analytically brilliant, socially obtuse, morally uncertain. Maren runs the Cold Lab — the facility that monitors external temperatures, ice formation, and atmospheric composition. She has the data that determines whether the Exodus ending is possible. She also maintains Wilford's population models — the ones that assume the Tail's eventual elimination.

**Appearance:** Pale from lab light, wire-frame glasses, perpetually cold (the Cold Lab is kept at 5°C for instrument calibration). Wears a lab coat over thermal underlayers. Her office is papered with temperature charts.

**Quests:**

1. **The Temperature Data** — Maren has seventeen years of external temperature data. She shows the player the trend: temperatures are rising. Slowly — 0.3°C total — but consistently. She doesn't know what this means for the outside world. She asks the player to retrieve a calibration instrument from Car 62 (Kazakov's territory) to verify her readings. If verified, the data confirms the Thaw is real — critical for the Exodus ending. *Reward:* Thaw verification data (endgame critical), Maren's trust, updated world map with temperature zones.

2. **The Population Model** — Maren shows the player Wilford's population projections. The numbers are devastating: the current population is unsustainable. Within 30 years, extinction. But Wilford's "optimistic" model shows a stable population of 1,500 — achieved by eliminating the Tail and most of Third Class. Maren doesn't endorse the model, but she can't refute the math. The player must decide what to do with this information. *Reward:* Population data (affects endgame decision framing), moral weight, potential Wilford confrontation material.

---

### 21. The Mechanic — "Gears" Tomoko Sato

**Full Name:** Tomoko Sato
**Age:** 55
**Location:** Car 58 (Mechanical Workshop)
**Role:** Master mechanic, car-coupling specialist
**Faction:** Working Spine (infrastructure, secretly saboteur)

**Personality:** Quiet, precise, harboring a dangerous secret. Gears has maintained the car-coupling mechanisms for twelve years. She knows how to disconnect any car from the train. She has never done it. But she has planned it — a contingency in case a section needs to be jettisoned (fire, structural failure, biological contamination). This knowledge makes her the most dangerous person in the Working Spine.

**Appearance:** Compact, efficient movements, hands that are more scar tissue than skin. Silver-streaked hair tied back. Wears mechanic's coveralls with custom tool holsters.

**Quests:**

1. **The Coupling** — Gears reveals her secret to the player: she can decouple any car from the train. She has never told anyone — not even Kazakov. She shares this because the player's revolution might create a scenario where it's necessary (isolating a compromised section, separating the Engine from the rest of the train). She asks the player to help her verify that her emergency procedures still work (technical puzzle in Car 58). *Reward:* Decoupling knowledge (endgame critical — required for the Derailment ending and optional for other endings), Gears as a technical ally.

2. **The Saboteur** — Someone has been subtly damaging infrastructure throughout the Working Spine. Gears suspects a fellow mechanic but can't prove it. The player investigates and discovers the saboteur is a Thaw Believer who is trying to force the train to stop — believing that if the train breaks down in a warming zone, survivors can walk away. The saboteur's logic is sound but the risk is catastrophic. The player decides their fate. *Reward:* Saboteur identified (prevents further damage or enables controlled stops), moral choice implications.

---

### 22. The Prisoner — "Brass" Aleksei Volkov

**Full Name:** Aleksei Volkov (no relation to Melena Voss's Volkov alias)
**Age:** 50
**Location:** Car 54 (Brig/Holding Cells)
**Role:** Imprisoned former Jackboot commander, intelligence source
**Faction:** Unaligned (former Jackboots, now disgraced)

**Personality:** Bitter, observant, strategically valuable. Brass was a Jackboot senior officer who was imprisoned for "insubordination" — he refused an order to suppress a Third Class work protest by lethal force. His refusal saved lives but cost him everything. He has been in the brig for three years. He knows Jackboot tactics, deployment patterns, and command structure from the inside.

**Appearance:** Weathered, military bearing even in prison clothes. Gray hair cropped to regulation length (old habits). Scars from combat and from the beating he received when arrested. Eyes that miss nothing.

**Quests:**

1. **The Debrief** — Brass offers to share everything he knows about Jackboot operations in exchange for release. His intelligence is genuine and valuable (patrol schedules, weapon caches, officer loyalties, the location of sympathetic Jackboots who might defect). But releasing him creates complications: Kazakov doesn't want a loose variable in his zone, and Brass's former subordinates might try to kill him. *Reward:* Jackboot intelligence (comprehensive tactical advantage for remaining zones), Brass as a temporary advisor.

2. **The Good Soldier** — Brass reveals why he really refused the order: one of the protesters was his daughter (she works in Third Class). He hasn't seen her since his imprisonment and doesn't know if she's safe. The player can find her (she's in Car 22, working in Ivan's factory) and bring a message. The reunion — through prison bars — is one of the game's most human moments. *Reward:* Brass's full loyalty, emotional scene, his daughter becomes a Third Class ally.

---

### 23. The Rat Catcher — "Tunnel" Yemi Adeola

**Full Name:** Yemi Adeola
**Age:** 33
**Location:** Car 52 (Maintenance Tunnels), mobile through undercarriage
**Role:** Vermin control, tunnel navigator, unofficial courier
**Faction:** Working Spine (infrastructure support, Kronole Network adjacent)

**Personality:** Cheerful, unfazeable, comfortable in places that terrify others. Yemi crawls through the maintenance tunnels beneath the train floor — narrow, dark, occasionally freezing — hunting rats that damage wiring and insulation. He knows the undercarriage better than anyone alive. He is also the unofficial postal service: for the right price, he'll carry messages between zones that bypass all security.

**Appearance:** Lean and flexible (tunnel-adapted physique), covered in tunnel grime, bright smile. Wears a headlamp and carries a net and a small crossbow designed for rat-sized targets.

**Quests:**

1. **The Rat King** — Something large is living in the tunnels beneath Car 57. Yemi's traps keep getting destroyed. He asks the player to help hunt it. The creature turns out to be a mutant rat colony — animals that have bred in the tunnels for seventeen years, growing larger and more aggressive. The hunt is a confined-space combat encounter with environmental hazards (steam vents, electrical exposed wiring, narrow passages). *Reward:* Yemi's friendship, full tunnel map (reveals hidden connections between zones), rat pelts (crafting material).

2. **The Courier** — Yemi has been carrying a sealed message between two unknown parties for months. He's never opened it (professional ethics). He asks the player to accompany him on a delivery run to Car 61 — the final delivery point is inside Kazakov's private workshop. The message turns out to be between Kazakov and Whisper (the surveillance operator from Zone 3): Kazakov has been receiving intelligence reports on the revolution's progress. The player must decide what to do with this information. *Reward:* Intelligence about Kazakov's awareness (affects Zone 4 boss encounter), Yemi's tunnel network access.

---

### 24. The Welder — Rosa Chen

**Full Name:** Rosa Chen
**Age:** 46
**Location:** Car 60 (Hull Maintenance Bay)
**Role:** Hull integrity specialist, exterior access technician
**Faction:** Working Spine (infrastructure, Thaw Believer)

**Personality:** Fearless, taciturn, haunted by what she's seen outside. Rosa is one of three people on the train authorized to perform exterior hull repairs. She has been outside — in a cold suit, tethered to the hull, in -80°C winds — forty-three times. Each time she sees the frozen world. Each time she notices the ice is thinner.

**Appearance:** Strong, sun-lamp-tanned (she uses the Working Spine's UV therapy), multiple frostbite scars on her face. Wears a permanently oil-stained jumpsuit. Her cold suit hangs on the wall of her workshop like a shrine.

**Quests:**

1. **The Window** — Rosa has cut a small observation port in the hull of Car 60 — unauthorized, dangerous, and the only place on the train where you can look outside without going through an airlock. She shows the player. What they see: endless ice, but with patches of dark ground visible at lower elevations. The world is changing. Rosa asks the player to keep the window secret — if Kazakov finds out, he'll seal it and discipline her. *Reward:* Visual confirmation of the Thaw (endgame context), Rosa's trust, access to cold suit equipment.

2. **The Exterior Walk** — Rosa offers to take the player outside the train during a scheduled hull inspection. This is a unique gameplay sequence: the player experiences the exterior of the moving train — wind, cold, ice, the terrifying vastness of the frozen world — while performing hull repairs. During the walk, the player can observe external details (damaged cars, ice formations, evidence of previous exterior activity) that provide lore and tactical information. *Reward:* Exterior experience (unique lore and atmosphere), cold suit proficiency (useful for endgame), hull repair skill.

## Zone 5: First Class (Cars 63-82)

### 25. The Tailor — Maurice Beaumont-Laurent

**Full Name:** Maurice Beaumont-Laurent
**Age:** 54
**Location:** Car 68 (The Atelier)
**Role:** First Class tailor, disguise supplier
**Faction:** First Class (loyal to aesthetics, not ideology)

**Personality:** Fastidious, observant, surprisingly kind. Maurice makes clothing for First Class — the gowns, suits, and uniforms that maintain the illusion of civilization. He is not political. He is an artist working in fabric. He will dress anyone beautifully, including a revolutionary who needs a disguise, because poorly fitting clothing is an offense against his craft.

**Appearance:** Immaculately dressed (he wears his own creations), graying temples, measuring tape draped permanently around his neck. Thin fingers, perfect posture, a monocle he doesn't need but wears for aesthetic reasons.

**Quests:**

1. **The Fitting** — Maurice offers to create a First Class disguise for the player. The fitting is a dialogue scene where Maurice asks questions about the player's journey (he's curious, not suspicious). The quality of the disguise depends on the player's answers — Maurice tailors the cover story as carefully as the clothing. A good disguise provides advantage on all social checks in First Class. A poor one (wrong answers, impatience) works but is fragile. *Reward:* First Class disguise (variable quality), Maurice as a social contact.

2. **The Commission** — Beaumont (the Zone 5 boss) has commissioned a gown from Maurice for a special event. Maurice asks the player to deliver a package to Beaumont's penthouse — it's the completed gown, but Maurice has sewn something into the hem: a note. The note is a warning to Beaumont from someone who cares about her: "They're coming. Leave the penthouse." Maurice won't say who asked him to deliver it. The player can deliver it honestly, read the note and decide what to do with the information, or use the delivery as cover for reconnaissance. *Reward:* Variable — access to Beaumont's penthouse area, intelligence about Beaumont's vulnerabilities, moral choice about the warning.

---

### 26. The Bartender — James "Jimmy" Okoro

**Full Name:** James Okoro
**Age:** 39
**Location:** Car 71 (The Lounge Bar)
**Role:** Head bartender, social intelligence hub
**Faction:** First Class (service staff — Third Class origin, assigned here)

**Personality:** Charming, perceptive, deeply resentful beneath the polish. Jimmy is Third Class-born, assigned to First Class as a service worker at age eighteen. He has spent twenty-one years pouring drinks for people who don't see him. He is invisible in the way servants are invisible — present, functional, decorative. He has heard every secret First Class has because they talk freely in front of the help.

**Appearance:** Handsome, well-groomed (First Class standards required), warm smile that doesn't reach his eyes. Wears bartender's formal attire (provided by the establishment). His hands are steady even when his thoughts are not.

**Quests:**

1. **The Cocktail Hour** — Jimmy offers to introduce the player to First Class social dynamics during a cocktail event. He points out who hates whom, who's having affairs, who's skimming rations, who's genuinely kind. This social mapping provides tactical advantage for navigating First Class. During the event, the player can gather intelligence by engaging in scripted social interactions. *Reward:* First Class social map (NPC relationships, vulnerabilities, potential allies), Jimmy's insights.

2. **The Poison** — Beaumont has ordered Jimmy to poison the player's drink at the next Lounge event. Jimmy tells the player in advance — not out of loyalty, but because he's done being a weapon. He asks the player to help him escape First Class and return to Third Class (his family is there). The player arranges the escape while navigating the poisoning attempt (switch drinks, confront Beaumont, use the attempt as evidence). *Reward:* Beaumont's assassination attempt exposed (evidence), Jimmy freed (Third Class ally), social consequences in First Class.

---

### 27. The Collector — Lord Ashworth

**Full Name:** Reginald Ashworth III
**Age:** 71
**Location:** Car 75 (Private Gallery)
**Role:** Art collector, Vivienne Ashworth's father, First Class power broker
**Faction:** First Class (old money, Wilford loyalist)

**Personality:** Cultured, condescending, genuinely in love with beauty. Lord Ashworth hoarded art before the freeze — his private gallery contains the last Monet, the last Vermeer, three Rothkos, and a Basquiat. He views these paintings the way Kazakov views the Engine: as things worth protecting regardless of cost. He is also Vivienne Ashworth's father (Zone 5 companion), and their relationship is complicated.

**Appearance:** Distinguished, white-haired, impeccable posture despite his age. Wears a three-piece suit that Maurice maintains. Carries a walking cane with a silver handle shaped like a train.

**Quests:**

1. **The Gallery** — Lord Ashworth invites the player to view his collection (if the player has a First Class disguise and high enough social standing). The gallery tour is a dialogue scene where Ashworth discusses art, civilization, and what's worth preserving. He makes a genuinely compelling argument for beauty's value. He also reveals, incidentally, the locations of hidden passages in First Class (the gallery was built with secret entrances for moving art). *Reward:* Hidden passage map (tactical advantage in First Class), cultural insight (unique Wilford dialogue option), potential alliance or enmity with Vivienne's father.

2. **The Forgery** — Ashworth suspects one of his paintings is a forgery — someone swapped a Rothko for a copy. He asks the player to investigate. The thief turns out to be a Third Class service worker who stole the original to sell through the Kronole Network (art has value even on a train — it's a status symbol). The player chooses: return the painting (Ashworth's loyalty), let the theft stand (Third Class gains value), or destroy both copies (nihilistic, but denies Ashworth his power symbol). *Reward:* Variable — Ashworth alliance, Third Class economic boost, or symbolic destruction.

---

### 28. The Doctor — Dr. Ingrid Sorensen

**Full Name:** Ingrid Sorensen
**Age:** 58
**Location:** Car 66 (First Class Medical Suite)
**Role:** First Class physician, Drawers administrator
**Faction:** First Class (medical establishment, morally compromised)

**Personality:** Professionally competent, ethically hollowed out. Ingrid is the best doctor on the train — board-certified surgeon, internist, and psychiatrist. She treats First Class with cutting-edge (pre-freeze) medicine. She also administers the Drawers — the cryogenic suspension system used as punishment. People who go into the Drawers are medically her patients. She maintains their vital signs, adjusts their sedation, and ensures they don't die. She doesn't decide who goes in. She just keeps them alive in there.

**Appearance:** Silver hair in a French twist, steady gaze, lab coat over a designer blouse. Her office is spotless. A framed photograph on her desk shows two children — they did not board the train.

**Quests:**

1. **The Drawers** — Ingrid reveals that the Drawers contain thirty-seven people in suspension. Some have been frozen for over a decade. She provides a list. Several names are significant: political prisoners, former Council members from Third Class, a pre-freeze climate scientist who knew about the Thaw before anyone else. The player can free specific prisoners — each awakening has consequences (allies gained, intelligence unlocked, but each freed prisoner needs medical recovery time and resources). *Reward:* Freed prisoners (multiple potential allies), Drawers intelligence, Ingrid's complex loyalty.

2. **The Hippocratic Question** — A patient in First Class Medical is dying. Ingrid can save them — but the required medicine is the last dose of a compound also needed by a Third Class patient (relayed through Yusuf's network). The player is asked to decide. This is a tier-3 moral choice. *Reward:* See Moral Choice Catalog — "The Last Dose."

---

### 29. The Gambler — "Ace" Viktor Reznikov

**Full Name:** Viktor Reznikov
**Age:** 43
**Location:** Car 73 (The Casino)
**Role:** Casino operator, odds maker, information trader
**Faction:** First Class (entertainment, Kronole Network adjacent)

**Personality:** Slick, mathematically brilliant, addicted to risk. Ace runs the Casino — the only place on the train where First Class citizens gamble with real stakes (rations, favors, housing assignments, even service worker contracts). He is not a con man — his games are fair. The house edge is transparent. He simply understands that people in luxury become reckless, and recklessness is profitable.

**Appearance:** Sharp-featured, always smiling, wears a dealer's vest over a silk shirt. His fingers are never still — he shuffles chips, cards, coins with unconscious precision. A scar runs across his left palm (knife fight in Year 3, before he ascended to First Class).

**Quests:**

1. **The High Stakes Game** — Ace invites the player to a private poker game with First Class elites. The stakes include a security access card to the Sanctum border (Car 82). The game is a social/skill encounter — reading opponents, bluffing, and managing risk. Winning requires Cunning and Perception checks. Losing costs resources. *Reward:* Sanctum access card (bypasses security at Zone 5/6 border), intelligence from player table talk, Ace's respect.

2. **The Fix** — Ace reveals that Beaumont has been rigging the Casino's high-profile games to ensure her allies win and her enemies lose. He wants the player to help expose the fix during a public game — humiliating Beaumont and undermining her social control. This requires planting evidence, coordinating with Jimmy the bartender, and timing the reveal for maximum impact. *Reward:* Beaumont's social power weakened (reduces her boss encounter difficulty), Ace's alliance, Casino reputation.

---

### 30. The Nanny — Elena Vasquez

**Full Name:** Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 44
**Location:** Car 67 (Children's Wing)
**Role:** Head nanny, First Class childcare provider, Third Class origin
**Faction:** First Class (service staff — Third Class origin)

**Personality:** Warm, protective, quietly documenting everything. Elena cares for First Class children with genuine love — they are children, regardless of their parents' politics. She is also Marta Vasquez's (Zone 1 companion) older sister, separated at boarding when Elena was assigned forward and Marta was stuck in the Tail. Neither knows the other survived.

**Appearance:** Matronly, soft-spoken, strong hands. Wears a nanny's uniform (practical, not ornate). Keeps a small journal hidden in her apron — she has been writing down everything she witnesses in First Class for seventeen years.

**Quests:**

1. **The Reunion** — If Marta Vasquez is the player's companion, entering Car 67 triggers a recognition scene. The sisters haven't seen each other in seventeen years. The reunion is emotional and complicated — Elena chose to stay in First Class (she could have requested transfer) because her children needed her. Marta views this as abandonment. The player mediates. *Reward:* Companion loyalty shift (Marta), Elena's journal (seventeen years of First Class observations — intelligence goldmine), emotional scene.

2. **The Children's Passage** — Elena reveals that the First Class children have a secret passage between Cars 67 and 72 (they use it to sneak to the Opera House). The passage bypasses Beaumont's security network. Elena offers access in exchange for a promise: no harm comes to the children during the revolution. *Reward:* Secret passage (tactical advantage), promise mechanic (breaking it has severe companion loyalty penalties).

## Zone 6: The Sanctum & Engine (Cars 83-103)

### 31. High Priest's Apprentice — "Ember" Miriam Kasongo

**Full Name:** Miriam Kasongo (Order name: "Ember")
**Age:** 24
**Location:** Car 88 (Acolyte's Quarter)
**Role:** Ezra's chosen successor, doubting apprentice
**Faction:** Order of the Engine (questioning)

**Personality:** Devout, intelligent, increasingly frightened. Ember was raised in the Order from age 8 — given to Ezra by her parents (Third Class, true believers). She has memorized every sermon, performed every ritual, and genuinely believed that the Engine speaks through Ezra. But in the last year, she has begun to notice inconsistencies: Ezra's "prophecies" sometimes contradict each other, his Kronole use is escalating, and the Order's "divine selection" program looks suspiciously like eugenics.

**Appearance:** Young, shaved head (Order tradition), ceremonial robes that seem too large for her. Intense eyes that are searching for something. Carries a small Engine-symbol pendant she made as a child.

**Full Character Sheet:**

*Backstory:* Miriam was born in Third Class and given to the Order at age 8 when her parents joined the faith. She has known nothing else. Ezra treated her as his own daughter — teaching her personally, sharing his visions, preparing her to lead the Order after him. She loved him. She still does. That's what makes the doubt so painful.

*The Doubt:* Six months ago, Ember witnessed Ezra fabricate a prophecy — he heard nothing from the Engine, but he spoke as though he had, because his Acolytes needed reassurance during a water shortage. She understood why he did it. She also understood that it meant at least some of his prophecies were lies. Which ones?

*Motivation:* Find truth. Ember doesn't want to destroy the Order — she wants to save it. She believes the faith could be genuine even if the prophet is flawed. But she needs to know: does the Engine really speak? Or has she given her entire life to a sick man's hallucinations?

**Quests:**

1. **The Test of Faith** — Ember asks the player to help her test Ezra's claims. She proposes an experiment: place a specific vibration pattern into the Engine room (using equipment from Kazakov's territory) and see if Ezra "hears" it in his next sermon. If he does, his connection is real (or at least responsive to actual stimuli). If he doesn't, it's fabrication. The experiment is mechanically complex and spiritually devastating either way. *Reward:* Evidence about Ezra's abilities (affects Zone 6 boss encounter), Ember's alignment shift, Order faction rep change.

2. **The Succession** — Ember confides that Ezra has named her his successor in a sealed document. If Ezra dies or is incapacitated, she becomes High Priest. She asks the player: what kind of Order should she build? This is a dialogue encounter with lasting consequences — the player's advice shapes the post-game Order (reform, dissolution, or radicalization). *Reward:* Post-game faction outcome, Ember as potential endgame ally.

### 32. The Confessor — Father Anatoly

**Full Name:** Anatoly Gregorovich
**Age:** 69
**Location:** Car 91 (The Confession Booth)
**Role:** Order interrogator, guilt-stricken enforcer
**Faction:** Order of the Engine (loyal but broken)

**Personality:** Gentle voice, terrible purpose. Father Anatoly operates the Confession Booth — the Order's interrogation facility disguised as a religious service. Confessions are recorded, analyzed, and used to identify dissidents. Anatoly knows this is wrong. He does it anyway because Ezra told him it serves the Engine. He has been slowly drinking himself to death with sacramental wine.

**Appearance:** Gaunt, trembling hands, deep circles under his eyes. Wears priest's robes stained with wine. His voice is soft and musical — the kind of voice that makes people want to confess.

**Quests:**

1. **The Recordings** — Anatoly offers the player access to the Confession recordings — years of intimate secrets from Order members and prisoners. The recordings include intelligence about the Sanctum's defenses, Ezra's private doubts, and evidence of the eugenics program. In exchange, Anatoly asks the player to hear his confession. He needs someone to know what he's done. *Reward:* Confession recordings (intelligence, evidence, emotional lore), Anatoly's absolution arc.

2. **The Mercy** — Anatoly reveals that three prisoners are being held in the Confession Booth's back rooms. They are dissidents from the Order — Acolytes who questioned Ezra and were confined for "spiritual correction" (isolation, deprivation, forced Kronole dosing). Anatoly wants them freed but cannot do it himself without being discovered. The player breaks them out. *Reward:* Freed Acolytes (potential allies in Ezra boss fight — they can turn other Acolytes), Anatoly's peace.

---

### 33. The Breeder — Helena Frost

**Full Name:** Helena Frost
**Age:** 51
**Location:** Car 93 (Eugenics Lab)
**Role:** Eugenics program administrator, geneticist
**Faction:** Order of the Engine (scientific wing)

**Personality:** Clinically detached, intellectually brilliant, morally blind. Helena runs the "Divine Selection" program — the Order's eugenics initiative. She screens couples for genetic compatibility, manages breeding schedules, and tracks genetic diversity across the train's population. She does not see this as evil. She sees it as population management in a closed ecosystem — which, stripped of the moral dimension, it technically is.

**Appearance:** Pristine lab coat, platinum blonde hair (rare on the train — genetic anomaly), precise movements. Her lab is immaculate. Charts on the walls track genetic lineages across the train.

**Quests:**

1. **The Genetic Archive** — Helena has mapped the genetic diversity of the entire train population. Her data reveals a crisis: genetic diversity is dangerously low. Within three generations, inbreeding depression will cause catastrophic health failures. The data has implications for every ending — it means the train cannot sustain humanity indefinitely regardless of political arrangements. The player obtains this data. *Reward:* Genetic diversity data (endgame critical — affects the weight of the Exodus ending), scientific lore.

2. **The Program's Victims** — The eugenics program has separated couples deemed "genetically incompatible" and forced pairings between "optimal" matches. Several of these forced pairings produced children who don't know their biological parents. Helena maintains the records dispassionately. The player can expose the program, destroy the records (freeing families from the data but losing scientific information), or confront Helena with the human cost. *Reward:* Variable — program exposed (Order faction rep -20, public outrage), records destroyed (genetic data lost), or Helena's crisis of conscience (she becomes a reluctant ally).

### 34. The Guard Captain — Sergeant Mika Virtanen

**Full Name:** Mika Virtanen
**Age:** 36
**Location:** Car 85 (Sanctum Gate)
**Role:** Head of Sanctum security, Ezra's personal guard
**Faction:** Order of the Engine (military wing, devout)

**Personality:** Disciplined, devout, tragically sincere. Mika believes with her whole heart. She joined the Order at sixteen after the Engine "saved" her life — a coolant explosion should have killed her, but a structural beam deflected the blast. She interpreted this as divine intervention. She has dedicated her life to protecting Ezra and the Sanctum. She is not a zealot — she is a soldier with a cause she genuinely believes in.

**Appearance:** Athletic, close-cropped blonde hair, ceremonial armor over practical combat gear. Carries an electrified stave (Order weapon) and a riot shield with the Engine symbol. Her armor has seventeen notches — one for each year of service.

**Quests:**

1. **The Checkpoint** — Mika guards the Sanctum entrance. She will not let the player pass without authorization — but she can be convinced to grant temporary access for a "pilgrimage" (the player claims to seek the Engine's guidance). The pilgrimage requires passing three tests of faith: knowledge of Order doctrine (learnable from Kessler or Ember), physical endurance (combat trial against a training Acolyte), and a "vision quest" (Kronole-assisted hallucination sequence). Completing the pilgrimage grants legitimate access. *Reward:* Sanctum access (non-violent entry), Order cover identity, Mika's respect.

2. **The Doubt** — If the player has evidence of Ezra's fabricated prophecies (from Ember's quest), they can share it with Mika. Her reaction is not anger but grief — "Then what saved me?" The player can offer alternative explanations (physics, luck, probability) or leave the question unanswered. Mika's response determines whether she stands aside during the Ezra boss fight or fights to the death. *Reward:* Mika's alignment shift (critical for Ezra encounter difficulty), emotional scene.

### 35. The Engine Child — Luka

**Full Name:** Luka (surname unknown — taken too young to remember)
**Age:** 12
**Location:** Car 101 (Engine access corridor)
**Role:** Engine maintenance child laborer
**Faction:** Unaligned (captive)

**Personality:** Quiet, mechanical, broken in ways the player can see. Luka has been inside the Engine since age 5. He maintains components that require small hands — replacing worn gaskets, cleaning filters, adjusting micro-valves. He knows the Engine's rhythms the way a musician knows an instrument. He does not speak much. He does not need to. The Engine speaks, and he listens — not in Ezra's prophetic way, but in the practical way of someone who has lived inside a machine for seven years.

**Appearance:** Small for his age, oil-stained skin, fingers scarred from hot metal. Wears a miniature maintenance suit. His eyes are old — the eyes of someone who has seen the inside of the world's most important machine and found it ordinary.

**Quests:**

1. **The Engine Room** — Luka can guide the player through the Engine's internal maintenance spaces — passages too small for most adults but navigable with Luka's help. This provides a secret route to Wilford's chamber that bypasses the Gauntlet (Ezra's arena). Using this route means the player arrives at Wilford's door without fighting Ezra — but also without confronting the Order's power, leaving it intact for the epilogue. *Reward:* Secret Engine access (alternate path to Wilford), Engine lore, Luka's rescue (affects epilogue).

2. **The Names** — Luka knows the names of every child who has worked in the Engine. Twelve are currently active. Twenty-five have "retired" (a euphemism — some were returned to their zones with scrambled memories, others simply disappeared). He asks the player to remember the names. This is not a quest with a mechanical objective — it is a narrative moment where the player sits with a child and listens to names. It connects to the memorial wall in Car 1 (Zone 1) and to Timmy's map. *Reward:* Names list (affects Wilford confrontation — the player can recite the names), emotional weight, memorial wall update.

### 36. The Engineer's Wife — Katarina Kazakova

**Full Name:** Katarina Kazakova
**Age:** 60
**Location:** Car 97 (Sanctum residential)
**Role:** Former chemist, Kazakov's estranged wife, Kronole pioneer
**Faction:** Unaligned (self-exiled to Sanctum)

**Personality:** Brilliant, remorseful, chemically knowledgeable. Katarina is the person who first synthesized Kronole — not from maintenance fluids (that was Zhora's independent discovery in the Tail), but from raw Engine chemicals in Year 2. She created it as a painkiller for the construction crews building the Sanctum. When it became addictive, she tried to destroy the formula. It was too late — the knowledge had spread. She has lived in the Sanctum ever since, maintaining a small chemistry lab and avoiding her husband (Kazakov), who blames her for the drug that has killed hundreds.

**Appearance:** Still handsome at sixty, silver-haired, steady hands. Her lab is organized with the precision of someone who channels guilt into cleanliness.

**Quests:**

1. **The Antidote** — Katarina has spent fifteen years developing a Kronole antidote. She has succeeded — partially. The antidote breaks physical addiction but cannot repair the neurological damage from long-term use. She gives the player a supply, enough to treat a dozen addicts. The player chooses who receives treatment. *Reward:* Kronole antidote (12 doses — can cure specific named NPCs including Emeka Okonkwo and Glass), Katarina's formula (can be reproduced if the player has access to a chemistry lab).

2. **The Reconciliation** — Katarina wants to speak to Kazakov before the revolution reaches the Engine. She hasn't spoken to him in six years. The player can facilitate a meeting (if Kazakov was handled non-violently in Zone 4) or carry a letter. The reconciliation scene is private and the player doesn't witness its content — but afterward, both Katarina and Kazakov are changed. Kazakov becomes more willing to cooperate; Katarina provides Engine schematics she has been hiding. *Reward:* Engine schematics (critical tactical information), relationship resolution, both characters available as endgame allies.
