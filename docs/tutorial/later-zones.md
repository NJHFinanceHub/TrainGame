# Later Zone Onboarding

## Design Philosophy

After the Tail's tutorial (Cars 1-5), new mechanics are introduced through three methods:
1. **NPC demonstration** - The player sees someone else do it first
2. **Necessity** - The environment demands a new skill to proceed
3. **Companion commentary** - A companion explains what they're seeing

No new pop-ups. No tutorial overlays. The game trusts that a player who survived the Tail can learn by observation and experimentation.

## Zone 2: Third Class (Cars 16-30)

### New Mechanics

**Machine Shop Crafting (Car 18)**
- **Introduction:** The player enters a proper workshop for the first time. A Third Class worker (Ivan Borodin's crew) is forging a tool at the Machine Shop station.
- **NPC demonstration:** The worker demonstrates the crafting flow at this higher-tier station: material selection, tool selection, forging process. The player watches the animation before they interact.
- **Companion:** Whisper: "Better tools than the Tail. Same principle though - materials in, product out."
- **Necessity:** A locked gate requires a specific tool (bolt cutter) that can only be made at the Machine Shop. The materials are nearby.
- **What's new vs Car 2:** Higher-tier recipes, tool requirements (some recipes need specific tools at the station), material quality tiers.

**Faction Reputation in Practice (Cars 16-22)**
- **Introduction:** Petra Kovic is organizing the strike. Multiple NPCs reference the Third Class Union's opinion of the player.
- **NPC demonstration:** The player witnesses a Third Class worker get preferential treatment from a merchant because of Union membership. "Union rate - half price."
- **Necessity:** Access to certain areas requires Union reputation. A locked door has a Union guard: "Members only. Prove you're with us." This can be bypassed with CHA or CUN, but reputation opens it cleanly.
- **What's new vs Car 5:** Reputation has tangible mechanical effects (prices, access, dialogue options). Multiple factions are visible simultaneously.

**Disguise System (Car 24)**
- **Introduction:** The player needs to pass through a Jackboot checkpoint.
- **NPC demonstration:** An NPC (a Tailie who made it to Third Class years ago) is wearing a worker's uniform to blend in. They whisper: "Dress the part. They don't look at faces, they look at clothes."
- **Companion:** Grey: "I can't fake being anything but what I am. But you're slippery enough."
- **Necessity:** A Jackboot patrol blocks the path. The player can fight, sneak, or disguise. Disguise is the lowest-risk option and teaches the crafting of disguise items at the Tailor's bench.
- **What's new:** Disguise as a non-combat solution. Integrates crafting (make the disguise) with social mechanics (maintain the cover through dialogue).

### Mechanic Deepening

**Weapon Degradation (first real occurrence)**
- The Scrap Shiv or Jackboot weapon from the Tail degrades after 3-4 real fights
- Visual indicator: the weapon shows physical damage (chips, bends)
- Audio cue: a dull thud replaces the sharp impact sound
- Companion: "That thing's falling apart. Find a grindstone or make something new."
- No tooltip needed - the player sees and hears the degradation

**Companion Conflict (first occurrence)**
- If the player has Whisper and Grey, they disagree on how to handle a Third Class situation
- Whisper wants stealth; Grey wants force. The player must choose or find a compromise (CHA 10+)
- This teaches that companions can disagree and the player must manage their group dynamics
- No mechanic explanation - the player experiences the tension and chooses

## Zone 3: Second Class (Cars 31-48)

### New Mechanics

**Surveillance Mechanics (Car 35)**
- **Introduction:** The Surveillance Hub is active. Cameras cover hallways and key areas.
- **NPC demonstration:** The player witnesses a Tailie refugee get caught on camera and arrested by Jackboots. The entire sequence plays out: camera spots them, alert sounds, Jackboots arrive within 30 seconds.
- **Companion:** Whisper: "Cameras. Watch the sweep pattern - they rotate. Blind spots exist."
- **Necessity:** The player must navigate a camera-covered corridor to reach the Archive. Options: disable cameras (CUN 8 at a junction box), time movement between sweeps (PER 6), or disguise past them (disguise holds up to cameras unless the player runs).
- **What's new:** A persistent environmental threat that requires spatial awareness and planning.

**The Trial System (Car 38)**
- **Introduction:** Magistrate Okonkwo holds court. The player can be put on trial or witness a trial.
- **NPC demonstration:** Another prisoner's trial shows the system: evidence presentation, character witnesses, magistrate's judgment. The player sees how CHA affects testimony and how evidence changes outcomes.
- **Necessity:** If the player was caught by cameras or Jackboots, they face trial. This is unavoidable in some paths - the trial IS the gameplay, not a cutscene.
- **What's new:** Extended social mechanics where the player's entire history of choices becomes relevant. Witnesses from earlier zones testify about the player's character.

**Hacking/Electronics (Car 40)**
- **Introduction:** The Comms Center has electronic locks and data terminals.
- **NPC demonstration:** Ren (the saboteur) demonstrates hacking a terminal in the player's presence: "Watch. Three digits, rotating cipher. Pattern repeats every eight cycles."
- **Necessity:** The Archive is electronically locked. The player must hack the terminal (CUN 7), find the code in a nearby office (PER 5), or convince an archivist to open it (CHA 8).
- **What's new:** A new interaction type (minigame-light: pattern recognition, not twitch reflex).

## Zone 4: Working Spine (Cars 49-62)

### New Mechanics

**Environmental Hazards (Car 52)**
- **Introduction:** The Working Spine has industrial hazards: steam vents, electrical conduits, chemical leaks.
- **NPC demonstration:** A maintenance worker gets burned by a steam vent. Their colleague shouts warnings and demonstrates the safe path through.
- **Necessity:** Progress requires crossing a hazardous section. The player uses SRV to identify safe zones, PER to spot hazard triggers, or END to tank the damage.
- **What's new:** The environment itself is an enemy. Combat and hazards can overlap (fighting near steam vents adds environmental damage to both sides).

**Engineering / Repair Mechanics (Car 55)**
- **Introduction:** Kazakov's domain. The player sees the train's infrastructure failing.
- **NPC demonstration:** An engineer repairs a critical pipe. The process shows material requirements, tool use, and skill checks in a non-combat context.
- **Necessity:** A section of track is failing. The player can help repair it (earns Kazakov's respect) or exploit it (the saboteur Ren wants to weaken it further). Both paths require understanding the repair mechanics.
- **What's new:** Crafting applied to infrastructure rather than personal items. The stakes are systemic rather than personal.

**Resource Scarcity Intensification**
- By Zone 4, resources are mechanically scarce (not just narratively)
- The player can't carry everything; inventory management becomes necessary
- Companion: "We need to choose. The medicine or the metal. Can't carry both."
- No tutorial - the full inventory prompts a "drop or leave" decision naturally

## Zone 5: First Class (Cars 63-82)

### New Mechanics

**Social Navigation / High Society (Car 65)**
- **Introduction:** First Class operates on social rules entirely different from the Tail.
- **NPC demonstration:** The player witnesses a First Class dinner party where status, conversation, and appearance determine access. An under-dressed guest is politely but firmly ejected.
- **Necessity:** The player must infiltrate First Class events to gather intelligence. This requires appropriate clothing (crafted disguise), social skill (CHA checks), and knowledge of etiquette (learned from NPCs or observation).
- **What's new:** The "combat" is entirely social. Saying the wrong thing or wearing the wrong outfit is as dangerous as a Jackboot ambush.

**The Drawers (Car 74)**
- **Introduction:** Cryogenic suspension pods containing prisoners.
- **No NPC demonstration** - this is a horror reveal. The player discovers it themselves.
- **Necessity:** A key NPC or piece of information is frozen in The Drawers. The player must navigate the system to access them.
- **What's new:** Ethical/mechanical hybrid - each pod has a person with a history. The player's choices here are both mechanical (who to free, resource cost) and moral.

## Zone 6: The Sanctum (Cars 83-102)

### New Mechanics

**The Gauntlet (Car 90)**
- **Introduction:** The Sanctum's combat defense corridor - trapped, guarded, designed to be impassable.
- **NPC demonstration:** An NPC ally attempts to run the Gauntlet and is injured/killed, showing the traps and guard patterns before the player attempts it.
- **Necessity:** This is the final combat gauntlet before the Engine. Everything the player has learned about combat, stealth, crafting, and environmental awareness converges here.
- **What's new:** Nothing mechanically new - this is a mastery test of everything learned. The design tests whether the tutorial worked.

**The Order's Rituals (Car 95)**
- **Introduction:** The Order of the Engine has religious ceremonies that use unique interaction mechanics.
- **NPC demonstration:** The player observes a ritual. Participating (or faking participation) requires understanding the ritual's pattern through observation.
- **Necessity:** Infiltrating the Order requires performing rituals convincingly. This is a PER check (observe the pattern) followed by a CUN check (replicate it) - combining two stats the player is familiar with in a new context.

## General Principles for Later-Zone Teaching

### The Three-Beat Pattern

Every new mechanic in Zones 2-6 follows a three-beat introduction:

1. **See it** - An NPC or environmental event demonstrates the mechanic
2. **Need it** - The player's path requires using the mechanic
3. **Master it** - A later challenge tests the mechanic at higher difficulty

This pattern replaces explicit tutorials entirely.

### Companion Contextual Commentary

Each companion has zone-specific knowledge that makes them natural tutorial voices:

| Companion | Knowledge Domain | Tutorial Role |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Whisper | Surveillance, stealth, information | Cameras, hacking, social intelligence |
| Grey | Combat, intimidation, Tail politics | Advanced fighting, threat assessment |
| Edgar | Enthusiasm, speed, recklessness | Asks questions the player might have ("What does that do?") |
| Samuel | Military tactics, security systems | Jackboot patterns, defense layouts |
| Asha | Medicine, chemistry, biology | Chemical hazards, healing crafting |
| Petra | Union politics, Third Class culture | Faction dynamics, labor systems |

### Never Re-Teach

A mechanic introduced in an earlier zone is never re-explained. The game trusts the player. If the player struggles, the hint system (see [hint-system.md](hint-system.md)) provides graduated assistance based on difficulty. But the game never says "Remember, you can craft items at a workbench!" after the player has already used one.

### New Mechanic Density

| Zone | New Mechanics | Deepened Mechanics |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Tail, Cars 1-5) | 5 (move, craft, fight, choice, quest) | 0 (everything is new) |
| 2 (Third Class) | 3 (machine shop, disguise, degradation) | 3 (faction, companion conflict, crafting quality) |
| 3 (Second Class) | 3 (surveillance, trial, hacking) | 2 (disguise, faction complexity) |
| 4 (Working Spine) | 2 (hazards, engineering) | 3 (resource scarcity, environmental combat, crafting scope) |
| 5 (First Class) | 2 (social navigation, drawers) | 2 (disguise mastery, moral choice weight) |
| 6 (Sanctum) | 0 (mastery test) | All (everything converges) |

The new-mechanic count decreases as the game progresses. By Zone 6, the player knows everything; the challenge is applying it all under pressure.
