# Tutorial Design & Onboarding Flow

## Design Philosophy

**No pop-ups. No HUD tutorials. No "Press X to jump" overlays.**

The player learns Snowpiercer: Eternal Engine through lived experience. Every mechanic is introduced by the environment demanding it, companions explaining it in-character, or NPCs demonstrating it. The Tail's first five cars serve as a naturalistic tutorial space where survival pressure teaches the player everything they need.

### Core Principles

1. **Environmental Teaching** - Level design forces discovery. A locked door teaches lockpicking. A collapsed beam teaches strength checks. A starving child teaches resource management.
2. **Companion as Instructor** - Whisper (recruited in Car 1) provides contextual dialogue that explains mechanics without breaking character. "That panel's loose - pry it open" teaches interaction before any tooltip fires.
3. **Necessity as Curriculum** - Players don't learn crafting because a tutorial says to. They learn it because they need a weapon and there's a workbench and scrap.
4. **Failure is Information** - The game never prevents the player from attempting something they'll fail at. A failed stat check teaches what stats do better than any codex entry.
5. **Difficulty-Scaled Hints** - Players who want more guidance get it. Players who don't, don't. The hint system is invisible on Hard, gentle on Normal, and explicit on Easy.

### Tutorial Pacing

| 3 (The Pit) | Combat Basics | Melee, stamina, formations, non-lethal options, practice ring |
| 4 (Kronole Den) | Moral Choices | Consequence weight, Hidden Ledger, no "right answer" design |
| 5 (Workshop) | Quests, Companions & Factions | Quest tracking, companion loyalty, faction reputation, party management |
