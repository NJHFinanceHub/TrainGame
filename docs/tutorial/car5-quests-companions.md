# Car 5: Workshop - Quests, Companions & Factions

## Setting Context

Car 5 is the Tail's Workshop, where repairs are made and tools are fabricated. It's the most "functional" car in the Tail - less despair, more purpose. Here, people contribute tangible skills. Samuel (Gilliam's security lead) uses it as an informal command post.

Car 5 is the final tutorial car. After this, the player exits the core Tail into the broader zone. This car consolidates everything learned so far and introduces the remaining core systems: quest management, companion loyalty and party dynamics, and faction reputation.

## The Convergence: "Everyone Wants Something"

### Beat 1: The Workshop Hub (0-2 minutes)

**Context:** Car 5 is the busiest space the player has seen. Multiple NPCs are present with their own agendas. For the first time, the player has multiple simultaneous requests competing for attention.

**NPCs present:**
- **Samuel** - Wants the player to scout the gate to Car 6 (security concern)
- **Old Yun** - Needs a specific part to fix a water recycler (crafting request)
- **Petra** (visiting from Third Class) - Is organizing a work slowdown and wants Tail support (faction introduction)
- **A second potential companion** - either **Edgar** (young, eager, impulsive) or **Grey** (if the player impressed him in The Pit) is available for recruitment

**Whisper:** "Busy place. Everyone wants a piece of you. Welcome to the revolution."

### Beat 2: Quest Introduction - Multiple Objectives (2-5 minutes)

**Context:** The player's main quest (find the missing child) is still active, but now secondary objectives stack on top of it.

**How quest tracking is taught:**

**No quest log popup.** Instead, the player experiences information overload - multiple NPCs asking for help - and the quest journal becomes a tool they seek out rather than one forced on them.

- If the player talks to Samuel, Old Yun, and Petra in sequence, they have three requests plus the main quest
- The quest journal is accessible from the pause menu (the player discovers it when they want to remember what everyone said)
- On Easy: after the third request, a subtle prompt appears: "Press [key] to review your objectives"
- On Normal: Whisper says "That's a lot to keep track of. I'll remember if you forget." (Hints that the journal exists)
- On Hard: no hint - the player discovers the journal organically

**Quest design in Car 5:**
- **Main quest:** Continue toward Car 6 gate to find the child - requires talking to Samuel about the gate
- **Samuel's request:** Scout the gate security (aligned with main quest - doing one advances the other)
- **Old Yun's request:** Find a pressure valve from the scrap pile (teaches item-fetch quests; reward: Yun fixes the water, giving a small heal-over-time buff for the zone)
- **Petra's request:** Talk to three Tailies about joining the work slowdown (teaches "talk to X people" quests; introduces faction mechanics)

**Teaching moment:** Samuel's request and the main quest overlap. This teaches that quests can interrelate - helping one person can advance another goal. The player who talks to Samuel first gets quest convergence; the player who talks to others first builds a broader picture.

### Beat 3: Companion Recruitment & Party Management (3-6 minutes)

**Context:** A second companion becomes available, creating the game's first real party decisions.

**Who's available depends on earlier choices:**
- If the player fought well in The Pit AND didn't antagonize Grey → Grey offers to come along: "You've got guts. The gate's not far but it's not friendly. I'll watch your flank."
- If Grey isn't available → Edgar approaches: "I want to help. I'm fast, I can fight. Please." Edgar is younger, less experienced, but eager.
- Both are available in some playthroughs, forcing a choice (party max is 3: player + 2 companions)

**What the player learns:**

**Party composition matters:**
- Adding a second companion opens the formation system fully (practiced in Car 3 if the player used the practice room)
- Each companion has different combat styles: Whisper is stealthy/ranged, Grey is tanky/melee, Edgar is fast/reckless
- The corridor is 3.2m wide - party positioning affects who can attack and who's exposed

**Companion AI behavior:**
- When the second companion joins, a brief in-character exchange teaches behavior settings:
  - Grey: "I'll take point. Keep your scout behind me." (defaults to Aggressive/front)
  - Edgar: "I'll stay close. Tell me what to do." (defaults to Defensive/follow)
  - Whisper: "I work best from behind. Let me pick my shots." (defaults to Passive/rear)
- The player can adjust these later, but the defaults are functional and character-appropriate

**Companion opinions of each other:**
- If both Whisper and Grey are present, they have a brief exchange that shows companion dynamics: Grey respects Whisper's intelligence but thinks she's too cautious; Whisper finds Grey reckless but reliable
- This teaches that companions have relationships with each other, not just the player

### Beat 4: Faction Introduction - Petra's Request (4-7 minutes)

**Context:** Petra (from Third Class) is the player's first contact with the broader political structure of the train.

**Petra's pitch:** "The Union's organizing a work slowdown in Third Class. We need the Tail's support. If your people stop cooperating with ration distribution, the Jackboots have to split their attention. Will you talk to some people?"

**What the player learns:**

**Factions exist beyond the Tail:**
- Petra represents the Third Class Union - the first faction the player encounters
- Her request introduces the concept that groups beyond the Tail have their own agendas
- Helping her improves Third Class Union reputation; ignoring her has no penalty (yet)

**Reputation is earned through action:**
- Talking to three Tailies about the slowdown is the task
- Each Tailie has a different reaction:
  - **Tailie 1 (favorable):** "About time. Count me in." (+small Union rep)
  - **Tailie 2 (skeptical):** "Third Class? They don't care about us. But... fine." (Requires CHA 5 to convince; +Union rep if successful)
  - **Tailie 3 (hostile):** "Slowdowns get people killed. Last time, Jackboots cracked skulls." (Cannot be convinced regardless of stats; teaches that not everyone can be persuaded)

**On Easy:** After completing Petra's task, a tooltip: "Faction reputation affects how groups treat you throughout the game."
**On Normal:** Petra says: "The Union will remember this. We take care of our friends."
**On Hard:** No explanation - the player feels the effects later.

**Faction list (introduced but not explained in full):**
- Gilliam's Council (Tail) - the player's default affiliation
- Third Class Union - introduced through Petra
- Others are mentioned by name only: "The Order," "First Class families," "Jackboot command" - they become real when the player reaches those zones

### Beat 5: The Gate Encounter (6-10 minutes)

**Context:** The main quest and Samuel's request converge at the gate separating the inner Tail from the outer Tail (and eventually the Third Class boundary). This is the first real combat encounter outside The Pit.

**Setup:** Two Jackboots guard the gate. They're not expecting trouble, but they won't let Tailies through.

**Multiple approaches (consolidating all tutorials):**

**Combat approach:**
- Fight the two Jackboots (uses everything from Car 3)
- Party formation matters: the corridor is narrow, only one fighter at a time in the front
- Companions assist based on their AI settings
- Winning gives the player a Jackboot weapon (upgrade from scrap) and armor piece
- Environmental combat introduction: the train lurches on a curve, and an unsecured crate slides. If the player notices (PER 5), they can use it as an environmental attack

**Stealth approach (CUN 6):**
- Whisper knows a maintenance crawlspace: "There's a way around. Tight, but we'll fit."
- The crawlspace bypasses the guards entirely
- Teaches that combat is optional when stealth is available

**Social approach (CHA 7):**
- Disguise using Jackboot gear (if player crafted or found a disguise component)
- Talk past the guards with a convincing story
- Requires setup from earlier cars (having the right items or information)

**Brute force approach (STR 8):**
- Force the gate mechanism open. Noisy, alerts the guards, but creates chaos that the party can exploit
- Teaches that high-stat brute force works but has tradeoffs

**After the gate:**
- The player sees beyond the inner Tail for the first time
- The missing child's trail continues forward
- This is the natural end of the tutorial - the "training wheels" section of the Tail is complete

### Beat 6: Tutorial Complete (implicit)

**No "tutorial complete" message appears.** The player simply finds that the game opens up:
- More cars to explore
- Side quests become available
- The main quest branches
- Companion conversations deepen
- The environment becomes less guided

**Whisper (if present, looking forward through the gate):** "We're past the edge of what I know. From here... we figure it out together."

This line serves as the unofficial end of the tutorial. The companion who's been guiding the player acknowledges that the guided phase is over.

## Systems Introduced in Car 5

| System | How It's Introduced | Depth |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Quest journal | Multiple simultaneous requests overwhelm memory | Basic (main + 3 side) |
| Quest interrelation | Samuel's request overlaps main quest | One example |
| Second companion | Recruitment based on earlier choices | Full party of 3 |
| Party formation | Combat encounter at gate | Practical application |
| Companion dynamics | Companion-to-companion dialogue | One exchange |
| Faction reputation | Petra's work slowdown request | One faction, basic |
| Environmental combat | Train lurch during gate fight | One instance |
| Multiple quest solutions | Gate has 4+ approaches | Full spectrum |

## Timing

Car 5 is the longest tutorial car: 10-15 minutes for a thorough player, 6-8 minutes for a focused one. This is appropriate - it's the final tutorial car, and the density of new systems requires more space. Players who rush through still learn the essentials; players who explore get the full picture.

## Cumulative Tutorial Summary

By the end of Car 5, the player has learned:

| Car | Core Mechanic | Supporting Mechanics |
|-----|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Movement & Interaction | Camera, dialogue, stat checks, companion recruitment |
| 2 | Crafting | Scavenging, material types, quality scaling, workbench use |
| 3 | Combat | Stamina, blocking, dodging, formations, non-lethal, practice |
| 4 | Moral Choices | Consequence weight, companion reactions, Hidden Ledger (hidden) |
| 5 | Quests & Social Systems | Quest tracking, party management, factions, multiple solutions |

**Total tutorial time:** 25-50 minutes (varies enormously by playstyle). The player never feels tutorialized - they've been surviving, fighting, and making choices in the Tail.
