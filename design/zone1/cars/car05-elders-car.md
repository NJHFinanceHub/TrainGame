# Car 05: The Elders' Car

**Type:** Quest Hub — Main Quest Begins, Companion Recruitment
**Difficulty:** None (social hub, no combat)
**Estimated Play Time:** 20-30 minutes (first visit, exploring all dialogue)

## Narrative Context

The political heart of the Tail. Here, the Elders — those who survived the earliest days and earned respect through endurance — meet to discuss the revolution that everyone knows is coming. Gilliam, the eldest and most respected, has been planning for years. He knows things about the train that no one else does. This is where the main quest formally begins: take the train.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Entrance Guard
- Two armed Tailies (pipe and shiv) guard access. The Elders' Car is restricted.
- A curtain/makeshift door separates this from the council. Creates a sense of importance.
- Guards know the player (you're Tail). They let you through after Pike vouches (if tutorial complete).

### Section B: Council Chamber
- **The War Table** — A large repurposed surface (industrial panel laid flat on crates). On it: a detailed hand-drawn map of the first 30 cars, pieced together from years of intelligence. Train position markers (carved pieces). This is the strategic planning hub.
- Crate seats for ~8 Elders. Not all present at once.
- **Faction totems** — Carved/assembled symbols on the walls representing Tail subgroups: the Fighters (Kez's people), the Makers (Forge's workshop), the Listeners (Whisper's intel). Visual faction representation.
- Side alcoves with hung blankets for private conversations. Two companion recruitment dialogues happen here.

### Section C: Gilliam's Space
- More personal than functional. Gilliam has a cot, a desk, and mementos from the old world.
- **Personal effects:** A cracked wristwatch (stopped at the time of the freeze), a photograph of a family (are they his?), a pressed flower (impossible — where did it come from?).
- **The Radio** — A gutted electronics unit. Legend says Gilliam received a message from outside once. The radio hasn't worked in years. Or has it?
- **Writing desk** — Gilliam's plans. Coded writing. If examined: hints about a contact in Third Class who feeds him information.

### Section D: War Room
- Where the revolution's logistics are staged. Not yet active — being prepared.
- Improvised weapon racks: pipes, shivs, a few shields made from car panels. This is the Tail's arsenal.
- **Mission Board** — A corkboard with pinned notes about intelligence targets, car layouts, guard rotations. This becomes the player's quest tracker for Zone 1.
- Supply crates: protein blocks, water skins, cloth wraps — what the revolutionaries will carry forward.

## Gameplay

### Main Quest: "The Long Walk"

Gilliam formally gives the player the main quest:

**Dialogue Summary:**
> "We've been planning this for seven years. Every route mapped, every guard rotation timed, every weakness catalogued. But plans don't walk through doors. People do. You walked through the Pit and came out standing. That's what we need."

**Quest: The Long Walk**
- **Objective:** Reach the Engine at the front of the train. How you get there — who you align with, who you betray, who lives and dies — is up to you.
- **Immediate sub-objectives:**
  1. Visit the Sickbay (Car 6) — Dr. Asha has intelligence about Jackboot patrol patterns
  2. Visit the Workshop (Car 7) — Arm yourself properly
  3. Reach the Blockade (Car 9) — First barrier to cross

### Companion Recruitment

Two companions can be recruited in this car:

**Kez (if she respects the player from Car 3):**
- Found in Section D, examining weapons.
- Recruitment dialogue: "I've been fighting in the Pit for scraps. I'd rather fight for something real."
- Requires: either beat her in the Pit, or complete a favor (retrieve her late partner's necklace from Car 1).
- Role: Melee combat specialist. Frontline fighter.

**Whisper (met formally here, introduced via lore in Car 8):**
- Found in a side alcove, Section B. Nervous, constantly looking over shoulder.
- "I know things. Routes through the Dark Car. Guard schedules. But I need protection to keep listening."
- Recruited automatically if player visits the Listening Post (Car 8) first and brings back intel.
- Role: Scout/intel. Provides advance warning of encounters, reveals hidden paths.

### Side Quests Available

| Quest | Giver | Description |
|---|---|---|
| "Kez's Necklace" | Kez | Retrieve a keepsake from Car 1. Simple fetch quest, emotional reward. |
| "The Missing Medicine" | Gilliam | Dr. Asha reported stolen medicine. Investigate in Car 6. |
| "Map the Dark" | Whisper | Enter the Dark Car (10) and chart a safe path. Unlocks stealth route. |
| "Forge's Request" | Mission Board | Bring specific scrap materials to the Workshop (Car 7) for a special weapon. |

### The Mission Board

A physical in-world quest tracker. Notes pinned to cork:
- Available missions (parchment notes with descriptions)
- Intelligence reports (guard movements, car conditions)
- Wanted notices (Jackboot descriptions, behavioral patterns)
- Player can take notes from the board — they appear in the journal/inventory.

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Train Map (Zone 1) | War Table | Key item — updates quest markers |
| Revolution Plan Notes | Gilliam's desk | Lore |
| Pressed Flower | Gilliam's effects | Lore (significant later) |
| Mission Board Notes (x4) | Mission Board | Quest items |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Gilliam** | Section C | Tail leader. Main quest giver. |
| **Kez** | Section D | Companion candidate. |
| **Whisper** | Section B alcove | Companion candidate. |
| Elder Tanaka | Section B | Council member. Cautious. Argues against revolution. |
| Elder Duma | Section B | Council member. Aggressive. Wants immediate action. |
| Guard A, B | Section A | Entrance security. Minor dialogue. |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Low — guards in shadow. Intentionally intimidating.
- **Section B:** Best-lit in the Tail. Multiple light sources: LEDs, candles, a salvaged desk lamp. The council needs to see the map.
- **Section C:** Warm. Personal. Gilliam's space has a quality of lived-in comfort — still poor, but cared for.
- **Section D:** Functional. Overhead fluorescent (steady, not flickering). Military staging lighting.

## Audio

- **Section A:** Quiet murmuring from beyond the curtain. Guards' shifting weight.
- **Section B:** Multiple voices in discussion. The scrape of crate-seats. Occasionally heated argument. When player enters: silence falls, then Gilliam speaks.
- **Section C:** Quiet. A clock ticking (Gilliam's broken watch makes no sound, but there's a metronome — his timing device for guard rotations).
- **Section D:** Metallic sounds — weapons being checked, crates being packed. The sounds of preparation.

## Revisit Behavior

- The Elders' Car is a persistent hub. The player can return to check the Mission Board, talk to Gilliam for guidance, or access companions.
- As the revolution progresses: the War Room fills with more supplies and more fighters.
- After the Blockade (Car 9): the Elders' Car becomes the forward command post. NPCs shift.
- If Gilliam dies (possible in late-game): Elder Tanaka or Duma takes over, depending on player choices.
