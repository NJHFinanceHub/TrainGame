# Car 07: The Workshop

**Type:** Weapon Crafting System Unlock
**Difficulty:** None (no combat, crafting focus)
**Estimated Play Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Narrative Context

Hidden behind reinforced walls and a false partition, the Workshop is the Tail's secret armory. Run by Forge — a former Third Class mechanical engineer who was sent to the Tail for sabotage — this is where scrap becomes weaponry. The Jackboots don't know it exists. If they found it, everyone in this car would be executed.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Decoy Space
- Looks like a normal Tail living car. Bunks, blankets, a few ambient NPCs maintaining the cover.
- **The hidden lever** is behind a specific pipe junction — player must be told or discover it.
- When activated: a wall section slides aside on rails, revealing the Workshop. The engineering is impressive — Forge's work.

### Section B: The Forge
- A salvaged anvil (piece of rail track) and a heat source (redirected steam line from the train's systems).
- Metalworking tools mounted on the wall: hammers, files, pliers, a hacksaw. All salvaged.
- **Weapon prototypes** on display: a pipe mace, a spring-loaded shiv, a shield made from a car panel. These showcase what's possible.
- A foot-powered grinding wheel for sharpening. Sparks fly when used.

### Section C: Crafting Hall
- **THE WEAPON CRAFTING BENCH** — The primary crafting station for weapons. More advanced than the Kitchen workbench. Multiple recipe slots.
- Component bins: sorted scrap metal (light, heavy), wire, leather strips, rubber, springs, glass shards. Organized by type.
- **Blueprint board** — Weapon recipes pinned to a board. Some are visible (unlocked), some are sketched but incomplete (locked — need materials or skills to unlock).
- **Testing dummy** — A mannequin-like figure made from wrapped cloth and pipe. Player can test crafted weapons here to see damage/speed stats.

### Section D: Arsenal
- Finished weapons on a rack. Most are reserved for the revolution. Player can see but not take all of them.
- Raw materials in crates. This is where the player can buy/trade for crafting materials.
- Improvised armor: arm guards from pipe sections, a chest plate from beaten metal, a helmet from a hard hat.
- Forge sleeps here among his creations.

## Gameplay

### Weapon Crafting Unlock

1. **Discover the Workshop** — Forge (or a guide NPC) reveals the hidden entrance. Dramatic moment as the false wall slides.
2. **Meet Forge** — Extended dialogue about his background (former engineer, demoted for helping Tailies access clean water). He's gruff, practical, brilliant.
3. **Crafting Tutorial** — Forge walks the player through crafting their first real weapon:

### Available Weapon Recipes (Zone 1)

| Weapon | Materials | Stats | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pipe Mace** | Heavy Scrap x2 + Wire | Slow, high damage | Stagger on hit |
| **Spring Shiv** | Light Scrap + Spring + Leather | Fast, low damage | Can backstab (2x) |
| **Shard Knife** | Glass Shard + Cloth + Wire | Medium speed/damage | Causes bleed |
| **Scrap Shield** | Heavy Scrap x3 + Leather x2 | Defensive | Blocks melee, breaks after ~10 hits |
| **Pipe Spear** | Heavy Scrap x2 + Wire x2 | Long reach, medium damage | Corridor control |
| **Knuckle Wraps** | Scrap x1 + Cloth x2 | Unarmed boost | Improves fist damage |

### Weapon Upgrade System
- Each weapon has 1-2 upgrade slots visible at craft time
- Upgrades require rarer materials (found in later cars)
- Example: Pipe Mace + Nails (from Car 13) = Spiked Mace (+damage, +bleed)

### Forge's Quest: "Forge's Masterwork"
- Forge wants to build a special weapon but needs a specific component: a "tension spring from a door mechanism"
- Available from Car 8 or Car 9 (environmental pickup)
- Reward: Forge's Cleaver — best Zone 1 melee weapon. Unique.

### Testing Dummy
- After crafting, player can attack the dummy to see weapon stats in action
- Damage numbers, attack speed, and special effects (stagger, bleed, etc.) displayed
- Helps player make informed weapon choices before the Blockade

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Crafting Materials (assorted) | Component bins | Crafting |
| Weapon Blueprint: Pipe Spear | Blueprint board | Recipe unlock |
| Weapon Blueprint: Knuckle Wraps | Blueprint board | Recipe unlock |
| Forge's Cleaver | Quest reward | Weapon (unique) |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Forge** | Section B/C | Blacksmith. Weapon crafting vendor/teacher. |
| Apprentice | Section C | Forge's helper. Minor dialogue. |
| ~3 cover NPCs | Section A | Maintain the decoy. Barks about "nothing to see here." |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Normal Tail lighting. Dim, fluorescent.
- **Section B:** Orange glow from the forge heat source. Dramatic shadows. Sparks.
- **Section C:** Good working light. Multiple salvaged lamps pointed at the bench. Forge needs precision.
- **Section D:** Moderate. Weapons gleam on the rack.

## Audio

- **Section A:** Normal Tail ambience. The false wall sliding is a low, heavy grind.
- **Section B:** Hammering on metal (rhythmic), steam hissing, grinding wheel whine, sparks crackling
- **Section C:** Quieter crafting sounds — filing, fitting, the snap of springs
- **Section D:** The clink of weapons on the rack when the train sways

## Revisit Behavior

- Workshop is permanently available after discovery
- Forge sells crafting materials (trade in protein blocks or scrap)
- New blueprints appear as player finds recipe items in later cars
- Weapons can be repaired here (weapon degradation system)
- During revolution: Forge arms the fighters. Mass production sequence (scripted).
