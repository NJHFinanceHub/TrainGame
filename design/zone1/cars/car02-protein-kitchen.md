# Car 02: The Protein Kitchen

**Type:** Tutorial — Crafting System Introduction
**Difficulty:** None (safe zone, first visit)
**Estimated Play Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Narrative Context

This is where the infamous protein blocks are made. Insects — cockroaches, crickets, beetles — are harvested from breeding tanks, ground into paste, compressed into gelatinous black bars, and distributed to the Tail. Everyone knows what's in them. Nobody talks about it. The Kitchen is run by Marta, a fierce woman who controls the most important resource the Tail has: food.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Breeding
- Glass tanks filled with writhing insects. The sound is a constant chittering.
- Green-tinted fluorescent overhead. Humid. Condensation drips down the tanks.
- Drainage troughs carry insect waste to recycling. The smell is oppressive.
- **Visual storytelling:** One tank is cracked and patched with tape. Insects occasionally escape — ambient movement on walls.

### Section B: Processing
- The grinder is a large hand-cranked machine. Two Tailies operate it in shifts.
- Pressing station compresses paste into block molds. Steam rises from the heated press.
- Marta stands behind a counter made from a repurposed door on crates.
- Drying racks hold finished blocks — dark, gelatinous, unappetizing.

### Section C: Distribution
- A shuttered window where blocks are handed out during rations (timed event).
- Metal queue barriers bolted to the floor — this gets crowded and hostile during distribution.
- Stacked crates of finished blocks. Some marked with chalk tallies.

### Section D: Storage/Private
- Marta's sleeping area behind a curtain. Better than most — she controls the food.
- Locked cage shelves hold extra supplies, special ingredients, confiscated items.
- **The Workbench** — A crude crafting station with tools. This is where the player learns to craft.
- A scrap pile near the exit door provides initial crafting materials.

## Gameplay

### Primary Objective
Old Pike sent you to collect your ration. Marta gives you a protein block — but only after you help with a task.

### Crafting Tutorial Beats

1. **Arrive and Observe** — See the Kitchen in operation. Ambient workers grinding, pressing. Marta notices you.
2. **Marta's Task** — "The grinder handle snapped. Fix it and I'll give you double rations." Teaches: crafting objective.
3. **Gather Materials** — Find scrap metal (scrap pile, Section D) and wire (hanging from ceiling conduit). Teaches: material gathering from environment.
4. **Use the Workbench** — Interact with workbench. Crafting UI opens. Combine scrap + wire = Improvised Handle. Teaches: crafting interface, recipe discovery.
5. **Repair the Grinder** — Apply handle to grinder. Marta rewards you with 2 protein blocks and access to the workbench going forward.
6. **Optional: Craft a Tool** — With remaining scrap, craft a Pry Bar (scrap metal x2 + wire). Useful for opening containers later.

### Discoverable Content
- **Inspect the tanks** — Lore about how the insect colonies were established. Some breeds are failing.
- **Talk to the grinder workers** — They hint that protein blocks used to taste different. Something changed.
- **Marta's ledger** — On her counter. Shows ration distribution is uneven. Some people get more. Why?
- **Locked cage** — Contains a jar of actual seasoning (salt). Can be stolen later with lockpick skill.

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Protein Block (x2) | Reward from Marta | Food |
| Scrap Metal (x2) | Scrap pile, Section D | Crafting |
| Wire (x1) | Ceiling conduit, Section A | Crafting |
| Pry Bar | Crafted at workbench | Tool |
| Marta's Ledger | Counter, Section B | Lore (inspectable, not takeable) |
| Insect Sample | Tank, Section A | Lore/Quest item (later use) |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Marta** | Section B, counter | Kitchen boss. Crafting tutorial quest giver. |
| Grinder Worker A | Section B | Ambient, dialogue about protein history |
| Grinder Worker B | Section B | Ambient, complains about shifts |
| ~5 ambient Tailies | Queue area | Waiting for rations, barks |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Green-tinted fluorescent. Humid fog. Eerie.
- **Section B:** Warmer — heat from the press. Orange-tinted work lights.
- **Section C:** Dim when distribution window is closed. Brighter during ration time.
- **Section D:** Low. A single bulb over the workbench. Shadows in corners.

## Audio

- **Ambient:** Insect chittering (constant, layered), grinding machinery, steam hisses
- **Section A:** Wet sounds, tank bubbling, the skitter of insects on glass
- **Section B:** Mechanical grinding (rhythmic), Marta's voice cutting through noise
- **Section D:** Quieter, the workbench has metallic crafting sounds when in use

## Timed Event: Ration Distribution

Periodically (every in-game day cycle), the distribution window opens. Tailies queue. Jackboots supervise. Tension is high. If the player is present:
- Can witness unfair distribution (some get less, some get none)
- Opportunity to steal extra blocks (risk: caught by Jackboots → reputation loss)
- Sets up later faction dynamics with Marta

## Revisit Behavior

- Workbench remains available for crafting throughout the game
- Marta sells/trades protein blocks and basic crafting materials
- If player has high reputation with Marta: access to special recipes
- During revolution (late-game): Kitchen becomes a supply depot
