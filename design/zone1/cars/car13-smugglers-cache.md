# Car 13: The Smuggler's Cache

**Type:** Trading System Unlock — Barter Economy
**Difficulty:** None (social/economic, optional stealth)
**Estimated Play Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Narrative Context

A hidden compartment car — originally a maintenance storage unit, now converted into a black market bazaar. The Trader (nobody knows their real name) runs an economy that shouldn't exist: goods flow between classes through a network of maintenance tunnels, corrupt Jackboots, and Kronole Network couriers. Here, anything can be bought — for the right price. The Trader doesn't care about revolution or class. They care about supply and demand.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Cover
- Looks like an unremarkable storage car. Crates, tarps, nothing interesting.
- The floor hatch is hidden under a specific crate that slides aside on rails.
- Access: The Trader must trust you (Kronole Network reference from Kim, or discovered through intel).

### Section B: The Market (Sub-Level)
- Below the main car floor, a cramped sub-level space (~1.8m ceiling) has been converted into a mini-bazaar.
- **4 stalls** operated by sub-dealers who answer to the Trader:
  - **Stall 1 — Weapons/Tools:** Better weapons than Forge can make (sourced from Third Class). Nails, spring mechanisms, quality steel.
  - **Stall 2 — Food/Medicine:** Real food (not protein blocks). Actual bread, dried fruit. Medicine from the Medical Bay (Car 26). Expensive.
  - **Stall 3 — Clothing/Armor:** Warm clothes, Jackboot uniform pieces (disguise potential), improvised armor. Lurker Pelts can be traded here.
  - **Stall 4 — Information:** Buy intel about forward cars. Guard rotations, car layouts, faction politics. The most valuable stall.
- Central aisle between stalls. Cramped, atmospheric. Other customers browse (2-3 ambient NPCs).

### Section C: The Trader
- Behind a cage partition (security). The Trader sits at a desk covered in a handwritten ledger.
- **The safe:** Contains high-value items — a real knife (pre-freeze), a functioning flashlight (batteries included), a forged Third Class ID. Available for trade at extreme prices.
- **Communication device:** A modified intercom connected to the train's maintenance system. The Trader communicates with contacts in forward cars. Not available to the player (yet).

### Section D: The Tunnel
- A narrow passage that runs under the train's floor between cars. Allows cargo to move without passing through guarded doors.
- The player can see it but cannot use it yet — it requires the Trader's trust and a later quest to unlock.
- This is how goods move between classes. The physical infrastructure of the black market.

## Gameplay

### Trading System Introduction

The barter economy is simple but deep:

**Currency:** There is no money. Everything is barter. The base unit of value is the protein block.

**Exchange Rates (approximate):**

| Item | Value (in Protein Blocks) |
|---|---|
| 1 Protein Block | 1 (base unit) |
| Scrap Metal (heavy) | 2 |
| Medicine Dose | 5 |
| Kronole Dose | 3 |
| Lurker Pelt | 4 |
| Quality Weapon | 8-12 |
| Real Food (bread) | 3 |
| Intel Report | 4-6 |
| Forged ID | 15 |
| Flashlight | 10 |
| Pre-freeze Knife | 20 |

**Trading mechanics:**
- Player opens trade window with a stall
- Both sides place items in offer/request slots
- The Trader (or sub-dealer) accepts if the value is fair (±10%)
- Reputation with the Trader affects prices (±20% at max rep)

### High-Value Trades

| Item | Cost | Gameplay Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Flashlight** | 10 PB equivalent | Permanent light source. Makes Dark Car trivial on revisit. |
| **Forged Third Class ID** | 15 PB equivalent | Allows bypassing certain checkpoints in Zone 2. |
| **Pre-freeze Knife** | 20 PB equivalent | Best non-crafted weapon in Zone 1. Never degrades. |
| **Intel: Car 15 Layout** | 6 PB equivalent | Reveals boss arena layout before the fight. |
| **Jackboot Uniform (partial)** | 8 PB equivalent | Disguise — reduces aggression from guards. |

### The Trader's Quest: "Supply Line"
- The Trader's supply line through the maintenance tunnel has been disrupted — a Jackboot patrol changed routes.
- **Ask:** Scout the tunnel and identify the new patrol pattern.
- **Method:** Enter the tunnel (Section D) and observe through grates — stealth mini-encounter, no combat.
- **Reward:** Permanent 15% discount on all trades + access to the tunnel as a shortcut between cars (bypasses Car 14 on revisits).

### Information Stall

Stall 4 sells intelligence reports:

| Report | Cost | Content |
|---|---|---|
| "Beyond the Threshold" | 4 PB | Car 15 boss encounter preview: Cmdr. Grey's equipment and tactics |
| "Third Class Conditions" | 3 PB | Zone 2 overview: what to expect |
| "The Network Map" | 5 PB | Kronole Network node locations in Cars 16-30 |
| "Jackboot Hierarchy" | 4 PB | Command structure: who reports to whom |

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (See trading inventory above) | Stalls | Various |
| Trader's Ledger | Section C (inspectable) | Lore — trade routes, contacts |
| Tunnel Map | Quest reward | Key item — shortcut access |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **The Trader** | Section C | Black market boss. Trading system NPC. |
| Weapons Dealer | Stall 1 | Sub-dealer. Gruff, knows weapons. |
| Food Dealer | Stall 2 | Sub-dealer. Former Third Class cook. |
| Clothier | Stall 3 | Sub-dealer. Practical, no-nonsense. |
| Intel Broker | Stall 4 | Sub-dealer. Whisper-like. Sells information. |
| ~3 customers | Browsing | Ambient. Show that the market serves the whole Tail. |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Normal storage car lighting. Unremarkable.
- **Section B:** Atmospheric. Each stall has its own light (improvised lamps). Warm, bazaar-like. The low ceiling creates intimacy.
- **Section C:** Focused. Desk lamp on the Trader's ledger. Their face is half in shadow. Intentionally cinematic.
- **Section D:** Dark. The tunnel is barely lit. Maintenance emergency strips only.

## Audio

- **Section A:** Silent. Normal storage car.
- **Section B:** A bustle of activity that's surprising given the small space. Quiet haggling, the clink of items being exchanged, cloth rustling. Atmospheric.
- **Section C:** The Trader's voice — measured, calm, slightly amused. The scratch of pen on paper (ledger).
- **Section D:** The tunnel carries sound from the undercarriage — wheels on track, wind, mechanical stress. Claustrophobic.

## Design Notes

- The Smuggler's Cache should feel like a secret — the player is being let into something exclusive.
- The sub-level construction sells the idea of hidden infrastructure. The train has layers.
- The Trader is morally neutral. They don't judge the player's choices. They provide access to resources the train's class system denies.
- The trading system should feel fair but resource-tight. The player can't buy everything. Choices about what to spend limited protein blocks on create meaningful resource decisions.

## Revisit Behavior

- Inventory refreshes over time (new items appear as story progresses)
- Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand (e.g., medicine becomes cheaper after accessing Car 26)
- The tunnel shortcut (if unlocked) becomes a key transit route
- In late-game: the Trader may offer endgame-quality items at extreme prices
