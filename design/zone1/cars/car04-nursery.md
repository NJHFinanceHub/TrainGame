# Car 04: The Nursery

**Type:** First Moral Choice
**Difficulty:** None (no combat)
**Estimated Play Time:** 10-15 minutes

## Narrative Context

Where the Tail's children are kept — those too young to work or fight. Run by Nani, an elderly woman who has cared for Tail children since the train began. But children have been disappearing. Taken forward "for education," the Jackboots say. Nobody believes that. The Nursery is a place of fear dressed as tenderness.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Sleeping Area
- Small bunks in 3-high stacks. Blankets are thinner here — children get cold.
- Mobiles made from bent wire and protein block wrapper origami hang from pipes.
- Nani's rocking chair (the only one on the train) sits by the story corner. A prized possession.
- Story corner has flattened cushions. This is where she tells children about "the world before."

### Section B: Play/Learning
- The floor is chalked with hopscotch grids, crude drawings, and counting exercises.
- Toys are handmade: carved wooden animals (from what wood?), cloth dolls, a ball made from wrapped rags.
- A chalkboard mounted on the wall shows simple lessons. Nani teaches.
- **The Drawing Wall** — Children's drawings cover a section of wall. Many show the train. Some show sunlight (they've never seen it). Some show a figure taking children away.

### Section C: Provisions
- Child-sized portions of protein blocks, cut smaller. A water jug with cups.
- Medicine cabinet is nearly empty — a few bandages, a single dose of fever reducer.
- Everything is rationed more severely than elsewhere. Children get less because they "need less."

### Section D: Private Area
- A quiet room used for isolation (tantrums) or comfort (nightmares).
- **Nani's Records** — A hidden notebook listing every child who was "taken forward." Dates, names, ages. Lore item.
- **Hidden Compartment** — Under a floor panel. Contains a small stash of extra food Nani has been hoarding for the children.

## Gameplay

### The Moral Choice

The player arrives to find a crisis: the children's rations have been cut again. Several children are visibly malnourished. Nani is desperate.

**Setup:**
1. **Enter and observe** — Children playing, but listlessly. Some are too weak to stand. Nani greets the player with weary hope.
2. **Nani's plea** — "They cut our rations again. The little ones can't take much more. If you find anything... please." She doesn't ask directly. She's too proud.
3. **The Discovery** — In Section D, the player finds Nani's hidden food stash (3 protein blocks). These are emergency reserves.

**The Choice:**

| Option | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **Leave the stash** | Children survive the next cut. Nani remembers your kindness. +Reputation with Tail civilians. Moral indicator: Compassionate. |
| **Take the food** | Player gains 3 protein blocks (significant resources this early). Nani is heartbroken. -Reputation with Tail civilians. Children's condition worsens. Moral indicator: Pragmatic. |
| **Share — take 1, leave 2** | Compromise. Nani understands. Neutral reputation impact. Some players will feel this is the "smart" choice — the game should make it feel inadequate. |
| **Give your own food** | If player has protein blocks, can donate them. Nani is moved. ++Reputation. Player goes hungry (debuff). Moral indicator: Selfless. |

**Design Intent:** This is NOT a "right answer" puzzle. It's establishing that the game's moral system is about scarcity, not good/evil. Taking the food is not evil — you might need it to survive the Blockade (Car 9). Leaving it is not automatically good — you might die without those resources. The game tracks the choice but doesn't judge.

### Additional Beats

- **Missing Children** — Talk to Nani about the children taken forward. She gives names. This becomes a thread the player follows throughout the game (the children are in the Engine — Car 102 reveal).
- **Drawing Wall** — Examining children's drawings provides lore fragments. One drawing shows a door with light behind it — a child dreaming of the outside.
- **Sick Child** — One child has a fever. If the player has medicine (rare at this point), they can use it here. Nani will remember forever.

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Nani's Hidden Stash (x3 blocks) | Floor panel, Section D | Food (moral choice target) |
| Nani's Record Book | Section D | Lore (inspectable) |
| Child's Drawing — "The Door" | Drawing wall, Section B | Lore |
| Cloth Doll | Play area, Section B | Lore/Trade item |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Nani** | Section A (chair) or roaming | Nursery caretaker. Moral compass NPC. |
| ~8 children | Throughout | Ambient. Some have single-line dialogue. |
| Sick Child | Section A, bunk | Quest target if player has medicine. |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Warmest in the Tail. Nani has collected extra light sources — 2 functioning LEDs, candle stubs. Still dim by normal standards, but the warmth is intentional.
- **Section B:** Overhead fluorescent (working). The chalkboard area is well-lit.
- **Section C:** Practical. Single bulb over the provisions.
- **Section D:** Dark. The quiet room is deliberately dim for comfort.

## Audio

- **Ambient:** Children's voices (subdued, not playful), Nani humming/singing softly, the omnipresent train rhythm
- **Section A:** A lullaby (Nani's, half-remembered from before the freeze)
- **Section B:** Faint chalk on board, scuffing feet, occasional weak laughter
- **Section D:** Silence. Just the train. The quiet room absorbs sound.

## Emotional Design Notes

- The Nursery should be the most emotionally affecting car in Zone 1.
- Visual contrast: children's attempts at beauty (drawings, mobiles, chalk art) against the industrial brutality of the car.
- The player should feel the weight of the moral choice physically — the UI should not present it as a clean menu. The player walks up to the stash and takes/leaves through interaction.
- Nani should never be hostile, even if the player takes everything. She's too tired for anger. Disappointment is worse.

## Revisit Behavior

- Nani's attitude reflects the player's choice (warm, neutral, distant)
- If player took the food: one less child present (too weak, moved to Sickbay)
- If player donated: children are slightly livelier, Nani offers small gifts
- During revolution: Nursery must be secured. Children are priority evacuation.
- Endgame: The missing children thread resolves based on the player's final choice in the Engine
