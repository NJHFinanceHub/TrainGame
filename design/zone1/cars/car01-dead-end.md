# Car 01: The Dead End

**Type:** Tutorial — Movement, Interaction, Inventory
**Difficulty:** None (safe zone)
**Estimated Play Time:** 15-20 minutes (first visit)

## Narrative Context

The rearmost car of Snowpiercer. A sealed steel wall marks the absolute end of the world. Beyond it: the coupling, then nothing but frozen wasteland at 300 km/h. This is where the Tailies who arrived last were crammed. It is the most densely populated, most desperate car on the train.

The player wakes here. This is home.

## Environmental Details

### Section A: Memorial/Sleeping
- **The Rear Wall:** Riveted steel, scratched with names of the dead. Flowers made from protein block wrappers. A child's shoe nailed to the wall.
- Bunks are stacked so tight people sleep in shifts. Personal items: photos, carved tokens, ragged blankets.
- A brazier made from a cut barrel provides dim orange light and meager warmth.

### Section B: Main Living
- The player's bunk is bottom-left, eye-level when standing. Tutorial starts here (wake up, interact with belongings).
- Central brazier is the social hub. NPCs gather here between scripted events.
- Storage crates contain communal supplies (tutorial teaches interaction/inventory).
- Water barrel with a ladle — condensation collected from pipes overhead.

### Section C: Elder's Corner
- Old Pike has a slightly larger space (privilege of age/respect, not comfort).
- A crude hand-drawn map of the train is pinned to the wall — first introduction to the train's structure.
- This is where the revolution will be planned (foreshadowing).

### Section D: Exit Corridor
- Narrower — partitions on both sides create a chokepoint.
- A lookout sits on a crate watching the door to Car 2. This is the "border" of the Dead End.
- The door to Car 2 is the first door the player will open.

## Gameplay

### Tutorial Beats (Sequential)

1. **Wake Up** — Player opens eyes in their bunk. UI prompts: look around (camera), get up (movement).
2. **Find Your Things** — Interact with a small box under the bunk. Teaches: interact button, inventory screen. Contains: a shiv (broken, unusable), a photo (lore item), a protein block.
3. **Talk to Your Neighbor** — NPC in adjacent bunk greets you. Teaches: dialogue system basics. Exposition about today being "count day" (Jackboots come to count heads).
4. **Go to the Brazier** — Walk to central brazier. NPCs react to player presence (ambient barks). Teaches: navigating cramped spaces, camera in tight quarters.
5. **Visit Old Pike** — He's at his table studying the map. Extended dialogue: introduces the train's structure, hints at revolution, gives the player their first objective: "Go to the Kitchen. Get your ration."
6. **Open the Door** — Walk to the Car 2 door. Teaches: door interaction. Loading screen masked by wheel-turn animation.

### Discoverable Content
- **Memorial Wall names** — Each name is a lore fragment. Some foreshadow later events.
- **Hidden note** — Under a loose floor panel near the rear wall. Written by a previous Tailie about a failed escape attempt. Teaches: environmental investigation.
- **Overheard conversations** — NPCs near brazier discuss rumors about the front of the train. Flavor and worldbuilding.

## Items

| Item | Location | Type |

## NPCs

| Name | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Old Pike** | Section C | Tutorial guide, mentor. Gives first objective. |
| Bunkmate (unnamed) | Section B, adjacent bunk | Tutorial dialogue partner |
| Lookout | Section D | Guards the door. Lets player through after Pike's quest |
| ~12 ambient Tailies | Throughout | Background population, barks only |

## Lighting

- **Section A:** Dim. Single brazier. Emergency LED strip along ceiling (flickering).
- **Section B:** Slightly brighter. Central brazier + 2 working fluorescent tubes overhead.
- **Section C:** Warm. Pike has a candle (rare luxury). Intimate feel.
- **Section D:** Dark. One overhead fluorescent, buzzing. Creates tension approaching the door.

## Audio

- **Ambient:** Train rhythm (constant), breathing/snoring from bunks, dripping condensation, distant metallic groans
- **Section A:** Low murmuring, occasional cough. A baby crying (faint, from a nearby bunk).
- **Section B:** More activity — conversations, shuffling, the crackle of the brazier.
- **Section C:** Quieter. Pike's voice is calm, measured.
- **Section D:** Wind howling faintly through door seals. The outside is close.

## Revisit Behavior

When the player returns to Car 1 later:
- Old Pike may or may not be here (depends on Car 9 outcome)
- Ambient NPCs comment on the revolution's progress
- New lore items may appear based on story state
- The memorial wall gains new names after major events
