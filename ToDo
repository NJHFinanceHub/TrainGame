## 1. PLAYER CHARACTER

### 1.1 Protagonist Definition — P0
- [ ] Define protagonist identity: named character vs. custom character creator
- [ ] If custom: define character creation options (gender, appearance, body type, voice)
- [ ] If named: write character backstory, motivation, personality traits
- [ ] Define protagonist's role in the Tail before the game starts (how long on the train, what they lost)
- [ ] Decide: voice acted or silent protagonist
  - If voice acted: define voice direction, emotional range, number of lines estimate
  - If silent: define how player personality is expressed (dialogue choices, actions)
- [ ] Define starting stats/attributes for the protagonist
- [ ] Define protagonist's unique ability or trait that justifies why THEY lead the push forward

### 1.2 Character Progression System — P0

- [ ] Define how stats affect gameplay:
  - Strength → melee damage, carry weight, forced entry
  - Endurance → cold resistance, stamina pool, hunger rate
  - Cunning → stealth effectiveness, lockpicking, crafting quality
  - Charisma → dialogue options, faction rep gains, companion morale
  - Perception → hidden item detection, enemy awareness range, environmental cues
  - Survival → resource efficiency, medicine effectiveness, Kronole resistance
- [ ] Design leveling system: XP-based, milestone-based (per car/zone), or hybrid
- [ ] Define XP sources: combat, exploration, quest completion, moral choices, stealth
- [ ] Design skill tree structure:
  - Combat branch (melee specialization, weapon mastery, counter-attacks, crowd control)
  - Stealth branch (silent movement, pickpocketing, disguise effectiveness, silent takedowns)
  - Survival branch (crafting efficiency, cold resistance, resource scavenging, medicine brewing)
  - Leadership branch (companion buffs, faction diplomacy, crowd manipulation, intimidation)
  - Engineer branch (hacking, trap-setting, environmental manipulation, lock bypassing)
- [ ] Define skill point acquisition rate — 1 per level? Per zone? Per major quest?
- [ ] Define max level / soft cap
- [ ] Design perk system: passive bonuses unlocked at level thresholds or via specific achievements
  - Example perks: "Tail Survivor" (reduced hunger rate), "Kronole Tolerance" (reduced addiction buildup), "Silver Tongue" (extra dialogue options with First Class)

  - Wind resistance mechanic at speed
  - Cold exposure timer while outside
  - Car-to-car rooftop traversal as alternate route
- [ ] Under-car traversal: maintenance catwalks beneath the train floor
- [ ] Jumping: limited or none? (Tight corridors make jumping weird — consider contextual mantling instead)

- [ ] Ladder/climbing speed affected by carry weight and injuries

### 1.4 Death & Respawn — P0

- [ ] Define "downed" state before full death (can companions revive?)
