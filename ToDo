## WHAT'S BLOCKING THE DEMO RIGHT NOW

**In priority order — fix these and you have a playable game:**

1. **No DataTables** — Inventory, quests, dialogue, collectibles all have C++ systems but zero data. The game literally has nothing to pick up, no quests to track, no NPCs to talk to.

2. **No character mesh/animations** — Player is invisible. Need at minimum UE5 Mannequin placeholder with basic anim blueprint.

3. **No pickup/NPC Blueprints** — C++ components exist but there are no placeable actors in the editor to put items or NPCs into the world.

4. **No persisted materials** — Materials only exist while the Python script session is active. They need to be saved as .uasset files.

5. **~6000 lines of orphaned code** — Source/SnowyEngine and Source/TrainGame have stealth, companions, crafting, economy, Kronole, and full Slate UI widgets that aren't compiled because they're not in the .uproject.

6. **Only 1 map** — DevTestCar is a box with pipes. Zone 1 needs 15 unique car layouts.

7. **2 audio files** — Need ambient, combat SFX, footsteps, UI sounds at minimum.
